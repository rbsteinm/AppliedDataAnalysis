    "- Finally we will use a maximum weight matching with max cardinality algorithm. Note that we have a minus sign in our weights because we want to minimize the weights even though we are using a maximum weight matching algorithm. We are using the method implemented in the NetworkX package. This method is based on the “blossom” method for finding augmenting paths and the “primal-dual” method for finding a matching of maximum weight, you can read more about it there : https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=6502 ."

The calendar year is the basic unit of every observation. Thus, if a conflict during the period June–September results in 30 casualties, that year will be recorded as a year of conflict. However, if the same number of casualties occurred in the period November–February and the conflict failed to reach the threshold of 25 battle-related deaths in either calendar year, neither year will be coded as in conflict. Start dates frequently refer to years prior to the first calendar year of a conflict, as the start of a conflict might be in a year with less than 25 fatalities. Small conflicts might not be included.\n",

    "- `sidea` : The first agent in the conflict (it has to be a government), this is always the same for each conflict ID, therefore we just take the value of the last observation for the aggregated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `side b` : The seconf agent in the conflict (it can be a government or an organisation), this is not always the same but after organisation we noticed that it was due to the organisation often changing name. Therefore we use the name of the organisation in the last observation for the aggregated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `incomp` : The incompatibility that led to the conflict. this is always the same for each CID, therefore we simply take the value of the last observation. Here are the three possible values :\n",

    "    - 2 : Government\n",
    "    - 3 : Both\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `cumint` : It is a variable that says if the conflict did more than 1000 battle related deaths since its begining. Of course it is not the same accross the same CID because it is a cumulative variable, therefore we take the value for the last observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Type` : The type of conflict. The type can change for the same CID. Though, we think that the most important is what the conflict was at its end (we have the `incomp` variable to tell us how the conflict began). Therefore, we take the last value for the aggregated dataset. There are four types of conflicts :\n",
    "    - 1 : Extrasystemic armed conflict occurs between a state and a non-state group outside its own territory.\n",
    "    - 2 : Interstate armed conflict occurs between two or more states. \n",
    "    - 3 : Internal armed conflict occurs between the government of a state and one or more internal opposition group(s) without intervention from other states.\n",
    "    - 4 : Internationalized internal armed conflict occurs between the government of a state and one or more internal opposition group(s) with intervention from other states (secondary parties) on one or both sides.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `startdate` : The date of the start of the conflict, it is the same across all raws for the same CID so we can take whatever line when we aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ependdate` : The end date of the episode observed. If this is the last episode it is the date of the end of the conflict for the CID. We take the date of the last observation when we aggregate then.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `region` : The region of the conflict, it is always the same across the same CID. Then we take the one for the last observation. The 5 regions are : \n",
