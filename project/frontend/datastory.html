                                 <p>The United Nations often gets criticised for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society has often been questioned. The UN exist since 1945, although until today the amount of conflicts around the world has not significantly diminished, does this mean that the UN is inefficient ? The Israelo-Palestinian conflict is allmost as old as the UN and no Peace Agreements (PA) could completely stop it as of today, so does the efforts made through the UN organization are worth the results ? Such a question would request more than a statistical study to be answered. Hence, we will focus on studying the impact of the UN in the domain of conflict resolution.
                                 	<br/>
                                 	Our study aims at giving an objective analysis of the impact of UN peace agreements on the evolution of conflicts around the world. We present the results of our analysis as a data story. Information relative to both conflicts and peace treaties are displayed on a world map in order to get an insight on the impact they have on one another.
                                 	<br/>To perform this, we used the UCDP dataset which provides information about the conflicts from 1945 to 2016 and peace agreements from 1975 to 2011.</p>

                                <h5>Distribution of the regions according to the Peace agreements</h5>
                                <p>We observe that the regions are not equally distributed, a large proportion of conflicts that take part in Europe or in Africa benefits from a or several peace agreements whereas there is almost no peace agreements in the Middle East or in Asia.
                                <p>The two distributions are indeed very different.</p>

								<p>If we look at the percentage of conflicts that received a Peace Agreement for each regions, we notice that one third of the conflicts received a peace agreements in Africa, one fourth in Europe, but only 7% in the Middle East.</p>

                                 <p>Here we filter the conflicts in order to only vizualize those who benefited from a peace agreements. We want to study if the distribution for the CID that benefited from a PA where the UN were involved is the same as the distribution for the CID that benefited from a PA where the UN were not involved. Here the distributions are looking alike. The only outliers we would have are for the Middle East and Americas regions. Indeed, in our database the UN never took part in a peace agreement for the Middle East region.</p>

                                 <p>Here we can see a bit of a difference between the distributions. Indeed, when we look at the conflict solved by the UN, Internationalized conflicts represents 20% of it whereas it's less than 10% for the conflicts that received a Peace Agreement but not from the UN.
                                 <p>The UN seem to be more focused on Internationalized conflicts than Interstate conflicts compared to the control distribution.</p>

                                The Peace Agreements contain a lot of information about the type of conflict they aim to solve, their own power of violence dissipation and the technicalities that should be set up to bring a more civilized life to the people concerned by the conflict. A deeper analysis of Peace Agreements is made below. </p>
                                Peace Agreements treating conflicts originating from both a governmental and territorial incompatibility have a 7% success rate.</center></p>

                                 <p>1991 is the year where most peace agreements were signed. There has been two periods with a low amount of peace agreement, from 1983 to 1987 and from 2009 to 2011. Until 1990, The UN were not taking part to Peace agreements except for the Peace Process agreement between Namibia and South Africa in 1978.</p>

                                <h5>Executive strength of Peace Agreements</h5>
                                <p> There are three types of agreements in terms of effectiveness :</p>
                                <ul type="disc">
                                    <li> Full peace agreement </li>
                                    <li> Partial peace agreement </li>
                                    <li> Peace process agreement </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Obviously, this goes from the most executive agreement to the least executive agreement, athough it does not translate the power of a Peace Agreement. Most peace agreements are partial peace agreements. Peace Process agreements are generally agreements that are signed at the begginning of a conflict and call for future peace agreements. This figure that UN involvment in the peace agreements does not change much the distribution of the the PAs types.</p>

                                 <p>Approximately half of the conflicts we studied that were solved, were solved in one peace agreement. However, peace agreement cannot allways be so efficient for all conflicts. Some conflicts needed more than a dozen peace agreements to achieve peace... or not even. The conflict between the Government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (1990-1996) needed 16 peace agreements to set a durable peace in the region. These were signed in six years and all of them are still valid as of today. </p>

                                <h3>Failing Peace agreements</h3>
                                <p>The Peace Agreements treating the conflict between Iran and Iraq could never establish peace. Each of the 12 agreements were signed in 1975. Despite the first agreements, that was signed by The Shah of Iran and SADDAM HUSSEIN, all of them were signed by the same two representatives of Iran and Iraq, respectively by ABBAS-ALI KHALATBARY, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iran and SAADOUN HAMADI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq. These agreements that were active in 1975, were then terminated between 1975 and 1980 until they were reactivated. Although the agreements were reactivated in 1980. Conflicts between Iran and Iraq did not stop in 1980, hence we can consider those agreements as complete failures.</p>The Republic of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front were in conflict from 1990 to 1994 when the revolutionnaries became the ruling political party. Six agreements were signed between 1992 and 1993. The five first agreements were signed to provide partial peace and the last one in august 1993 was supposed to prvide full peace to the region. None of the agreements provided for the holding of national talks to solve incompatibility and for the integration of rebels into civil service. In April 1994, a genocide broke out and the peace agreements were never fully implemented. The armed wing of the Rwandese Patriotic front ended the genocide in 1994.</p>
                                The agreement to solve the governmental incompability between Namibia and South Africa was signed in 1978 and lasted two months. The agreement contained provisions for political incompatibilities leading to independence for Namibia, justice provisions with the return of refugees and release of political prisoners and behavior regulations such as (ceasefire, withdrawal of foreign forces and demobilisation of local armies).
                                </p>The agreement covered indigenous rights and culture and strengthened the position of the indigenous people in Mexico. The accord was never implemented and thus further peace talks that were planned in September the same year were suspended by EZLN. No exact date for the ending of the peace accord has been found.</p>

                                <h3>Insight on the Peace Agreements</h3>
                                 <p>Each Peace Agreement is defined by a few charateristics for each type of political provision (a provision is a clause in legal instrument). Below we give details about the most recurring clauses.</p><h6> Regulation of warring parties behavior</h6><p> Most Peace Agreements that contain behavioral clauses provide for a ceasefire and the disarmement of foreign forces. Two kinds of agreements were never terminated. The ones which provided for the creation of a new national army or the integration of rebels into the army and the withdrawal of foreign forces.
                                 </p><h6>Regulation of governmental incompatibilities</h6><p> 72% of the Peace agreements concern governmental incompabilities. Peace agreements that provide governmental provisions mostly provide for elections and electoral reforms for rebel integration into the interim government. The main difference that can be observed between UN agreements and non UN agreements is that the UN agreements usually provide provisions for an interim government and elections while non UN agreements msotly only provide provisions for an election.</p><h6>Regulation of territorial incompatibilities</h6><p>Territorial conflicts are mostly treated by Peace Agreements with clauses about the demarcation of a border or the government granting the disputed region to the other warring party.</p>

The most recurring clause is the release of prisoners. The UN being involved in the negociations of a peace agreement generaly increases the chances of including a justice clause.</p>

                                In this part, we will explore if the Peace Agreements where the United Nations acted as a third party performed better than the peace agreements where the UN did not act. </p>
                                In order to do so, we will check the proportion of peace agreements that are ended in both cases.</p>

                                 <p>First, let's just compute the proportions straight from our Peace Agreements database. </p>
                                   We observe that 34% of the agreements that included the UN ended, this proportion goes up to 36% for the agreements that did not include the UN. A chi square two-sample proportion test gives us a p-value of 0.82 so we don't reject the null hypothesis that these proportions are equal. This totally naive analysis can't give us a conclusion to our problematic, we can not say anything about the UN performances at this point.</p>

                                <h5>After performing a propensity score matching on the Peace Agreements</h5>
                                <p>Our previous analysis was quite naive as we saw on the earlier part about the PAs that they are not equally dristributed accross the two classes that are UN / not UN.</p>
                                In order to solve this problem, we decided to perform a propensity score matching among the PAs, having the UN involvment as a treatment. To do so, we matched the 68 UN peace agreements using a propensity score mathing algorithm (you can check our notebook for further details).</p>
                                We observe that, after these PAs are matched we have that only 30% of the agreements that did not include the UN ended. With this analysis, ee could think that the UN is performing worst than the other 3rd parties. But it is important to remember that we matched the PAs according to the caracteristics of the peace agreements, not the caracteristics of the conflicts. This means our analysis is still biased as we saw in the first part of this story that the UN solved conflicts that were more deadly and governmental than the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                Let's perform the matching on the conflicts as well to conclude our analysis.</p>

                                <h5>When matching on the conflicts as well</h5>
                                 <p>When matching on the conflicts as well, we observe that 42% of the conflicts solved by another 3rd party than the UN failed. This is way higher than the fail rate of the UN that is of 33%.</p>
                                 When matching on the conflicts, we observe that the UN peace agreements are way more stable than the ones performed by other 3rd parties. Indeed, we observed in the previous parts that the UN was taking care of a larger part of deadly governmental conflicts compared to the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                 A naive analysis first showed us that the UN was performing as good as other 3rd parties if not worst, but when pushing this observational study further we showed that it is bringing more stability when it is involved in the resolution of a conflict.</p>

It should be noted that UN biggest challenges does not land in the resolution of existing conflicts but rather in the settlement of communication channels to avoid the creation of tensions between countries.
