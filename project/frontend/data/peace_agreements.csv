5521975120101	318	Zimbabwe (Rhodesia): government	2	Declaration of intent	1975-12-01	"Type: peace process agreement
 
During the last three months of 1975, talks were held between the government and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo. On 1 December 1975, Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith signed a declaration of intent.
 
No provisions were made to regulate the armed activity between the parties.
 
With regards to the incompatibility, the declaration of intent stipulated the initiation of constitutional talks. The negotiations would culminate in a constitutional conference held somewhere outside the country. 

There were also provisions for immunity for the participating rebel representatives. Following the declaration of intent, talks began in mid-December, but were adjourned until the beginning of 1976."	1	1976-03-19		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Zim%2019751201.pdf	0	0	0	0	Zimbabwe	ZWE
5521979122101	318	Zimbabwe (Rhodesia): government	2	Lancaster House Agreement	1979-12-21	"Type: full peace agreement
 
The Lancaster House Agreement contained three parts, negotiated in sequence: i) the independence constitution, ii) pre-independence arrangements, and iii) a ceasefire agreement and related practical arrangements. On signing the agreement, the parties agreed to abide by all these arrangements.
 
The ceasefire agreement would begin by a cessation of cross-border movements by midnight 21 December 1979, followed by a complete cessation of hostilities on 28 December. A ceasefire commission, consisting of representatives from both sides, would monitor the ceasefire. The Military Adviser of the British Governor would establish and command a monitoring force containing troops from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya and Fiji. PF forces would report to designated assembly points by 4 January. Demobilisation and the creation of a new national army would be left for the independence government, but the UK would be ready to assist in training, as well as in reintegration of demobilised fighters.
 
Regarding the incompatibility, the independence constitution outlined the system of democratic elections and government. It was declared that Zimbabwe would be a sovereign Republic. Suffrage would be held by all citizens over the age of 18, who would elect a parliament which would consist of a House of Assembly and a Senate. 1/4 of Senate and 1/5 of Assembly seats would be elected by the white minority. The parliament would elect a President, who would be Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. The President would appoint a Prime Minister and other ministers. Key principles for a declaration of rights and provisions for an independent judiciary were also included.
 
During the transitional period, Zimbabwe would remain a British dependency under the name Rhodesia, and would be administrated by a British Governor. The Governor would hold executive power and the armed forces of both sides to the conflict would abide by the Governor's directions. The British government would cede independence to Zimbabwe following free and fair elections. There were also provisions for release of prisoners, return of refugees and for the preparation and supervision of the elections.

3451991071201	384	Yugoslavia: Slovenia	1	Brioni Agreement	1991-07-12	Partial peace agreement On 7 July, the parties met to discuss the EC's proposal of a partial peace agreement. The proposal included a three-month suspension in the implementation of Slovenia\'s dissociation from Yugoslavia. During this period, negotiations would begin on the future of all the republics. The proposal also included that the Croat Stipe Mesic should be elected as President of the Federal Presidency as well as an immediate cessation of hostilities. Furthermore, Slovenian police would be allowed to control the republic\'s international borders, while the JNA would take control of security for the period of three months. Up to 50 European observers would also be brought in to protect the cessation of hostilities. The peace agreement must be seen as partial as it touched upon the incompatibility but did not fully regulate or solve the matter of dispute.	0	2099-01-01	The peace agreement was not broken, yet, its implementation did not proceed without problems. The withdrawal of troops began almost immediately after the agreement. However, when signing the agreement, the Yugoslavian Collective Federal Presidency imposed a number of new demands, for instance the return of the Slovenian borders to the situation prior to 25 June. Slovenia ignored these demands. Negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia started on 22 July, but broke down when Croatian President Tudjman refused to cooperate with the Serbian republic. The republic of Slovenia respected the moratorium on the implementation of its independence. However, in October, when the moratorium had expired, Slovenia formally ended its association with Yugoslavia even though there had been no official conclusion of the future of the Yugoslavian republics.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Yug%2019910712.pdf	1	0	0	1	Republic of Serbia,Croatia	SRB,HRV
3451999060301	412	Yugoslavia: Kosovo	1	Kosovo peace agreement 1	1999-06-03	"The accord was not a peace agreement in the strict sense of the term. The two parties never effectively signed the one and the same agreement. Two peace plans were presented/negotiated by the NATO and the G8 representatives - one on 23 February 1999 and the other on 3 June 1999. The UCK signed the February agreement \""Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government In Kosovo\"" and the Yugoslav government the June agreement. On 20 June, the UCK signed an \'Undertaking of demilitarisation and transformation by the UCK\'. In this undertaking, the UCK reaffirmed its commitment to the terms of the February agreement.The content of the February and the June peace plans were very similar. They were both so-called \'peace process agreements\', outlining a process for - but not determining - the regulation of the incompatibility. The process entailed establishing a provisional administration model promoting the conditions for the establishment of a broad autonomy for Kosovo. In other words, the international presence in Kosovo was to encourage a political process towards the establishment of an interim political framework agreement, providing for a substantial self-government for Kosovo. Other key points of the agreements included: an immediate end to the fighting, a withdrawal of all Yugoslav government troops, the disarmament of the UCK, the safe return of all refugees and the installation of a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.On 9 June, a military technical agreement was signed between NATO and the Yugoslav government, specifying the conditions for the NATO-led peacekeeping force and the withdrawal of the Yugoslavian troops."	0	2099-01-01	No unambiguous assessment of the success of the implementation can be given. Most of the components of the peace agreement have been initiated/are ongoing/terminated. Even if the process outlined for regulating the incompatibility is on a standstill, efforts are underway. The peace agreement cannot be considered as ended.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Yug%2019990603.pdf	1	1	1	1	Republic of Serbia,Croatia	SRB,HRV
2001998041001	315	United Kingdom: Northern Ireland	1	The Good Friday Agreement	1998-04-10	"Partial peace agreementAfter a long series of negotiations, all eight Northern Irish parties participating in the multi-party talks agreed on the content of the Good Friday Agreement (also called the Belfast Agreement). The first part of the agreement, crucial for the Unionists, stated that Northern Ireland constitutional status could only be changed if a majority of the Northern Irish people so desire. It was decided that a referendum would be hold every seventh year to establish whether the majority wish to unite with the Republic of Ireland. Next in the agreement were the clauses of \'Strand One\', which included the establishment of a Northern Irish parliamentarian assembly (with mechanisms guaranteeing influence from both catholic and protestant parties) and a coalition government (with both catholic and protestant parties). The clauses of \'Strand Two\' of the peace agreement involved the establishment of a North-South Ministerial Council (with representatives from the Irish government and the Northern Irish government) It was mentioned that the council had the right to consider to establish a joint parliamentary forum. The clauses of \'Strand three\' established a British-Irish Council (including also representatives from the regional institutions in Northern Ireland). A permanent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was to replace the institutions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.Apart from the regulation of the constitutional issues, the agreement also read that the paramilitary groups should be disarmed within two years, under the monitoring of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD). Another controversial part of the agreement was the release of those prisoners charged with terrorist acts that belonged to groups that had declared a ceasefire. The IRA issued a statement saying that it would judge the agreement \""against its potential to deliver a just and durable peace\"". On 22 May, referenda were arranged in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, on whether or not the peace agreement should be ratified/adopted. More than 71% voted yes in Northern Ireland and the peace agreement could thereby be adopted. Both a majority of the Northern Irish Protestants (51%) and of the Catholics (99%) supported the agreement. In the Republic of Ireland (where the yes percentage was 94,4), a referendum was also arranged on constitutional changes concerning Ireland\'s legal claim on Northern Ireland."	0	2099-01-01	"The peace agreement cannot be considered as ended. None of the parties have stated their wish to give up the agreement. The violence between the parties has also been reduced, apart from a limited number of attacks carried out by breakaway factions of the IRA. Furthermore, most of the clauses of the agreement have been fulfilled. On the other hand, there have been serious problems with one of the dimensions of the implementation of the agreement. This concerns the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons. Already on 30 April 1998, the IRA issued a statement saying that \""the agreement falls short of presenting a solid basis for a lasting settlement\"" and \""let us make it clear that there will be no decommissioning by the IRA\"". This approach was recurrent in the following years. At the same time, the IRA has confirmed its \""definitive commitment\"" to the peace process and at times cooperated with the weapons inspectors. Sinn Féin\'s approach has been that nothing in the Good Friday Agreement stipulates that decommission has to occur before an Executive coalition government can be formed. The Unionist parties, on the other hand, have rejected the formation of the Executive before the decommissioning starts.As of the end of 2002, the Northern Irish institutions were (for the fourth time) suspended and direct rule from London installed. May 2000 was set as the deadline for the completion of the decommissioning. Nevertheless, there have been constant efforts to make the peace agreement survive. Several clauses from the agreement have been implemented. Thus, the Good Friday Agreement is considered as ongoing."	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/UK%2019980410.pdf	1	0	1	1	United Kingdom	GBR

The Nairobi peace agreement was signed by the military council and NRM on 17 December, following several rounds of talks in Nairobi. 

The accord provided for a ceasefire to be implemented within 48 hours, for a new national army to be formed with 8480 men, comprising 3700 from UNLA, 3580 from NRA and 1200 from the other groups and for the capital to be completely demilitarised. 

Regarding the incompatibility, i.e. who would govern Uganda, the agreement stipulated that a Military Council made up of Gen Tito Okello as chairman and head of state, seven UNLA and seven NRM representatives and five from the smaller groups would rule the country until a national conference could be organised to prepare for an interim government and elections.
 
The Nairobi Peace Agreement made provisions for the installation of a foreign peace keeping force, composed initially of men from Kenya and Tanzania, and later possibly from Britain and Canada, to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

The Agreement on Accountability and Reconciliation between the Government of the Republic of Uganda and the Lord\'s Resistance Army/Movement was the second accord signed within the Juba peace process.

In the accord, the parties agreed to establish a viable national alternative to ICC indictments. The agreement provides for the formation of a domestic legal framework that will function as a substitute for the ICC prosecutions. This is to be complemented by alternative processes like traditional justice. Under the accord, the rebel commanders that are accused of serious crimes will face formal criminal and civil justice proceedings in courts, which can impose as of yet undetermined ""alternative penalties and sanctions"" that will replace existing penalties"".

The Commission was also responsible for setting up a Central Commission on Elections and the holding of a referendum on possible constitutional reforms. It would also monitor the exchange of prisoners and the resettlement of displaced persons.

A universal amnesty was also declared, to include both warring parties."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Taj%2019970518.pdf	0	1	0	1	Tajikistan	TJK

The final peace agreement in Tajikistan’s peace process reaffirmed the earlier protocols, signed between 1995 and 1997, and concluded deals on all outstanding issues.

Extensive reforms of the military and security sector were agreed upon, with UTO rebel fighters being integrated into the national army. Those not integrated were to be the subjects of a DDR program. The agreement also stated that 30% of positions within the law enforcement agencies would be allocated to UTO members. Relocation of the troops and the integration and demobilization process would be monitored by the UN mission, UNMOT.

Political deals centered upon power-sharing in a number of established commission and committees charged with holding democratic elections and to work with the reconciliation in the country. UTO were to be represented in these commissions and committees through an equal number of chairman and co-chairmanships and a representation of 25-50%; the figure varying between the different institutions. The government was to be reformed to include UTO members (30%), and the commissions would agree upon political and electoral reforms to allow for multi-party elections in the future.

Further, a general amnesty was proclaimed and a protocol on refugee issues stated that all refugees and IDPs were to voluntarily return and be assisted in their resettlement.

Talks in Addis Ababa between Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), one of three parties in Khartoums ruling coalition, and SPLM/A resulted in the signing on 16 November of the DUP/SPLM Sudan Peace Agreement also called the November Accords. 

The agreement between SPLM/A and DUP called for a ceasefire, the abrogation of all military agreements and the lifting of the state of emergency. 

The incompatibility would be solved through the holding of a national constitutional conference by 31 December 1988. The agreement also called for a freeze in the implementation of Islamic Sharia laws by the postponement of the introduction of the proposed new legal code until the national constitutional conference would be held."	1	1988-12-21	The agreement was to be of short duration due to events in the government later the same year. The opposition in the coalition government, National Islamic Front (NIF), did not accept the Addis Ababa agreement and were reluctant to freezing Islamic law and towards abrogating pacts with Egypt and Libya. NIF, which denounced the Addis Ababa talks as ‘conspiracy’ to block Islamic law, and the Prime Minister Sadiq al- Mahdi voted down a DUP amendment to recognize the terms of the SPLA-DUP accord. Although al-Mahdi initially encouraged the peace talks, he himself was not committed to the accord. Some observers have criticized this move from al-Mahdi as trying to appear to support peace while keeping the NIF in the Government. However, DUP resigned from government as of 27 December that year.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/SUD%2019881116.pdf	1	1	0	0	Sudan	SDN

After months of protracted negotiations following on the peace process agreement signed between the two parties in Cairo in January 2005 the Government of Sudan and the NDA signed another peace agreement in Cairo on 18 June 2005.
 
The peace agreement is linked to the agreement signed the same year by the GoS and the SPLM, calling for power- and wealth sharing for Sudan (9 January 2005), and binds the two settlements together. It covers a wide-range of issues, but does not completely specify its power-sharing and military aspects.
 
The agreement stipulates that Sudan will be a multiparty non-confessional democracy with equal rights for all citizens and be open to all political parties. The NDA, previously being banned and in exile, are allowed to return to Sudan to conduct democratic politics and will take part in the drafting of the new Sudanese constitution as stipulated in the 9 January 2005 comprehensive peace agreement. It further binds the NDA to taking part in the Interim Government of Unity and the federal decentralization process in the interim time period of six years. The state of emergency is to be lifted to allow for a democratic transition throughout the interim period leading up to free and fair multiparty elections.
 
Further, the peace agreement commits the two parties to form a number of commissions, for example a constitutional, a political and a military committee, to discuss implementation of the peace agreement. The civil servant forces and the national armed forces are to be restructured on the basis of equality for all the peoples of Sudan.
 
The agreement however does not specify the exact number/quota of NDA participation in the Government of National Unity, or the exact fate of the NDA's military forces. These issues are instead placed within the mandate of two committees that are to work out these details during the course of more negotiations. In October and November 2005 the NDA joins the Government of National Unity and the parliament of Sudan following discussions on these issues."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Sud%2020050618.pdf	1	1	1	0	Sudan	SDN
6252006050501	309	Sudan: government	2	Darfur Peace Agreement	2006-05-05	"Partial peace agreement
 
On 5 May 2006 the Government of Sudan and the SLM/MM (Minni Mannawi faction) signed a peace agreement concerning the three states of Darfur, in the Nigerian city of Abuja. The agreement contains a total of 6 annexes, all which are reaffirmed. The peace agreement was meant to be signed by SLM/AW and JEM as well as SLM/MM, but the two former groups refused to sign, leading to the peace agreement mentioning all groups, but applying only to SLM/MM.
 
This dyadic peace agreement, being wide in scope, covered such issues as national and state power-sharing, demilitarization of the Janjaweed and other militias, an integration of SLM/A and JEM troops into the Sudanese Armed Forces and police, a system of federal wealth-sharing for the promotion of Darfurian economic interests, a referendum on the future status of Darfur and measures to promote the flow of humanitarian aid into the region.
 
The agreement contained a comprehensive ceasefire agreement (CFA), which reaffirmed in particular the N'Dajema Agreement of April 2004. The CFA forbade mobilization, recruitment, military actions and propaganda, and stipulated the release of all detainees. It also contained measures to protect humanitarian aid routes and IDPs. The CFA was to be monitored and verified mainly by AMIS, whose force strength was to be enhanced by international partners. An important part of the CFA was the neutralization of the Janjaweed and the Popular Defence Forces, for which the GoS was responsible. The agreement stipulated that the GoS was to take all measures available to neutralize the threat posed by these groups operating in GoS territory. Disengagement, redeployment and demobilization were sequenced according to a step-by-step plan according to a specified time-frame.
 
The chapter on Final Security Arrangements outlined the final moves for demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. Forces of SLM/A and JEM were to be integrated into the security institutions of Sudan, with a total of 4000 soldiers being integrated into the armed forces, 1000 being integrated into the police and another 3000 being given professional and educational training for reintegration into civilian life. Integrated battalions were to be composed of between 33% and 50% SLM/A or JEM troops. Senior positions in SAF command and HQ were also to be granted to the movements, at a total of 20%. The agreement further stipulated reforms of various security institutions, for instance the Border Intelligence Units, the Popular Defence Forces and the Popular Police, in order to increase equitable representation and professionalism.
 
Regarding the incompatibility the agreement both touched on political representation and the future status of Darfur. In the political sphere the most important provisions were power-sharing at the national and state level, the creation of a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority (TDRA), a referendum and general moves towards the equitable representation of Darfurians in Sudanese affairs. Up until elections, i.e. in the interim period, the SLM/A and JEM would be represented at the national level by a Senior Assistant to the President, to be selected from a list of nominees by these two movements. This Senior Assistant was to be placed at the head of a number of councils and committees in order to ensure influence over national policy. Further, the 3 posts of Cabinet Minister held by Darfurians would remain, and an additional Cabinet Minister and 2 posts of State Minister would be allocated to SLM/A and JEM nominees. 12 seats in the legislative would also be awarded to such nominees. Power-sharing arrangements were also agreed upon within Darfur, with the seat of Governor of 1 of the 3 Darfurian states to be held by a SLM/A and JEM nominee, and with 2 seats of Deputy Governor in all other states. Ministerial positions were also to be given to these movements, along with 21 seats out of the 66 seat legislatures of the three states. Lastly, the GoS was to ensure the fair and equitable representation of Darfurians in the national judiciary and civil services. The TDRA would be responsible in the interim period for certain aspects of the implementation process, with the responsibility also of recommending national and state legislation to enhance cooperation and coordination. Pending elections 6 SLM/A nominees and 6 JEM nominees would run local governments. The permanent status of Darfur would be determined by a referendum, to be held no later than July 2010. In this referendum the two alternatives would be; 1) the creation of a unified Darfur region, or 2) status quo with 3 existing Darfurian states (north, south and west). 

On wealth-sharing and fiscal redistribution the peace agreement stipulated a complex structure of federal fiscal relations, with the general aim of fiscal equalization of the Sudanese states. For this purpose Darfur would be given priority in resource redistribution, and also benefit from the Darfur Reconstruction and Development Fund. This part of the agreement also outlined some moves towards land reform, with the affirmation of tribal land ownership and the principal of restitution in cases of lost land. To arbitrate in land disputes the agreement stipulated the creation of a Land Commission, which would make binding decisions on land rights. The distribution of land between different groups, however, was not specifically regulated.
 
The GoS, the TDRA and international partners were responsible for the reconstruction of Darfur, and of the creation of conditions susceptible to the voluntary return of refugees and IDPs. AMIS would monitor and patrol humanitarian aid routes and demilitarized IDP camps to ensure the return of IDPs and refugees. The agreement also stipulated a donor conference to accumulate the necessary resources for the reconstruction and development of Darfur's economy.
 
One of the final provisions was the stipulated holding of a Darfur-Darfur dialogue conference, to which all stakeholders in the conflict would be invited to discuss the conflict, reconciliation, community building and issues of land and natural resources. Such a conference would recommend policy and advise the government on legislation to promote peace and reconciliation."	1	2010-12-31	The duration of the DPA ended at the end of 2010. At that time the government and SLM/A (MM) clashed at three different times. Also, Mini Minawi said that he was thinking of joining forces with SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid. In addition the government declared Mini Minawi and his forces being a legal target.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Sud%2020060505.pdf	1	1	1	1	Sudan	SDN

The date cited is the date when SWAPO announced it agreed to the settlement proposal put forward by the Western Contact Group (WCG). South Africa had accepted the proposal in April. The agreement was then encompassed in a UN Security Council Resolution, UNSCR 435, on 29 September. 

With regards to regulation of armed activity, the proposal stipulated confinement to bases of South African and SWAPO troops, a gradual reduction of South African troops in the territory to 1500, and a transitional process controlled jointly by South Africa and the UN. The agreement also stipulated demobilisation of local armies. Immediately after the adoption by the UN of the plan, on ""D-Day"", a ceasefire would begin, the warring parties would be confined to bases, and the UN force would take charge over security. Over 12 weeks from ""D-Day"", the South African forces would be cut back from some 20-40 000 to 1500. 

Concerning the incompatibility, the agreement outlined a process for free and fair elections leading to independence for Namibia. The South African Administrator-General would remain in Namibia and administer the elections, but the process would be supervised by a Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and a 5000-strong UN Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) would secure order during the transition period. A week after the South African forces were reduced to 1500, the election campaign would begin, and one week after the Special Representative had certified the elections South Africa would withdraw completely and the new government would be installed. The date for independence was envisaged for 31 December 1978.
 
The agreement also stipulated return of refugees, release of political prisoners, and abolition of apartheid policies. The UN endorsed the agreement through a succession of resolutions in July-September 1978. In UNSCR 431 on 27 July, the Security Council requested the Secretary General to appoint a Special Representative and take other steps necessary to begin implementation of the independence plan. Another resolution, UNSCR 432, on the same day outlined the UN's position that Walvis Bay was an integral part of Namibia (the issue of Walvis Bay had been left outside of the Settlement Proposal, a fact both parties had accepted). Martti Ahtisaari was afterwards appointed as the Special Representative. On 29 September, the Security Council in UNSCR 435 definitely established the independence plan."	1	1978-09-20		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/SyA%2019780712.pdf	1	1	1	1	South Africa	ZAF

Following a crisis in the peace process in June 1992, when ANC withdrew from CODESA (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) following a massacre of ANC supporters in Boipatong township near Johannesburg, a series of talks were held between Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer (chief negotiators for the ANC and the government, respectively). These talks, aiming at removing the obstacles to further constitutional talks and addressing issues unresolved in previous bilateral talks, culminated in a Record of Understanding signed by Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk on 26 September.

 The Record of Understanding addressed the ongoing factional violence which constituted a main obstacle to a resumption of negotiations. With this in mind, and based on the findings of the Goldstone Commission which had been set up to investigate the ongoing violence, the government undertook to address the causes identified such as particular urban hostels.

Following several months of deadlock after CODESA (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) collapsed in June 1992, multiparty negotiations on a new constitution resumed in April 1993. This time negotiations took place under the banner of the Multiparty Negotiating Process (MPNP), attended by delegations from 26 political groups. On 18 November the multiparty negotiation delegates announced agreement on an interim constitution. 

All the signatory parties rejected violence and promised to work for a free and fair election process. The interim constitution stipulated the creation of a single, unified army and police force, in line with the overarching principle of equality between races and genders. 

The interim constitution fully resolved the incompatibility between ANC and the government of South Africa. It provided for a proportionally elected National Assembly and a Senate representing the nine provinces. There would be a Government of National Unity made up of the parties gaining at least 5 % of the vote, with those parties getting one seat in the government for every 5 % of the vote it obtained. The president would be elected by the National Assembly, and there would also be at least two Deputy Presidents. The National Assembly and the Senate were together responsible for establishing the final constitution, which would have to enshrine a number of principles drawn up in the constitutional negotiations; they included provisions for a unitary state, a multiparty democracy, universal human rights, checks and balances on state power, and an independent judiciary. 

The interim constitution also included a timetable for implementation and elections, and a definition of the new administrative divisions of South Africa.

5201993032701	337	Somalia: government	2	Addis Ababa Agreement	1993-03-27	Partial peace agreementThe peace agreement was signed on 27 March 1993 in Addis Ababa.In the agreement the parties firstly committed themselves to a previously signed ceasefire agreement, and to complete  disarmament through the handover of weapons to UNITAF/UNOSOM (the multinational United Task Force that was transformed into the UN Operation in Somalia). A restructuring of the national police force would commence, in order to create an impartial national and regional police force.Secondly, the parties agreed to set up a Transitional National Council (TNC) and three other transitional organs, for a period of two years, that would eventually lead to democratic governance, the rule of law, decentralisation of power, and the protection of human rights and individual liberties. The TNC would have legislative functions during the transition period, and it would further establish an independent judiciary. It would be composed of representatives from all regions in Somalia and all political factions that participated in the National Reconciliation Conference (and consequently signed the agreement). Moreover, Central Administrative Departments, Regional Councils and District Councils would be established. Hence, the incompatibility of government was given a solution through this agreement.	1	1993-06-05	The peace agreement was signed on 27 March 1993 and ended on 5 June 1993, and thus lasted for 2 months and 9 days. First on 15 April Aideed said at a news conference that although there were some elements who did not want the Somali problem to be solved, the recent peace agreement signed in Addis Ababa would be implemented. However, on 5 June Aideed's forces launched an attack on UN troops that they, in the agreement, had committed themselves to co-operate with and hand over weapons to.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Som%2019930327.pdf	1	1	0	1	Somalia	SOM

5202008081901	337	Somalia: government	2	Djibouti Agreement	2008-08-19	"Peace process agreement
 
The 19 August 2008 marks the official signing of a 9 June political agreement between the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS).
 
The agreement provides for the cessation of hostilities within 30 days and the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops, a question at the core of the conflict incompatibility. The parties agreed to request that the United Nations (UN) deploy an international stabilisation force within 120 days. The agreement also provided for the establishment of a High Level Committee, to pursue issues of political cooperation between the parties, as well as a Joint Security Committee, to develop and follow up the implementation of security arrangements.
 
The Djibouti Agreement followed two rounds of talks, and was the first in a series of cooperation documents and agreements. In accordance with the Djibouti Agreement, a third round of talks took place on 25-26 October 2008, resulting in two political documents based on the work of the Joint Security and High Level committees. ""Modalities for the Cessation of Hostilities between the TFG and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS)"" drafted arrangements for a ceasefire to become effective on 5 November, the relocation of Ethiopian troops deployed to Somalia, the impending transition of security-related tasks from Ethiopian troops first to AMISOM forces and later to the anticipated UN force to Somalia, as well as including the first modalities for a joint TFG/ARS security force. A second political document, the ""Joint Declaration on the Government of National Unity and the Expanded Parliament"", reiterated the commitment to political cooperation on behalf of the parties. 

However, discrepancies between the parties of the talks and the actors on the ground made the implementation of political progress difficult. In fact, the peace proceedings that had intended to marginalise hard-liners with a broad-based coalition of moderates caused rifts on both sides. As a consequence, agreements forged in the talks had little bearing for the developments on the ground."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/SOM%2020080819.pdf	1	0	0	0	Somalia	SOM

In line with the peace process launched with the 19 August 2008 Djibouti Agreement, a fourth round of talks began on 22 November 2008. The talks resulted in a power-sharing deal between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the Alliance for Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS). The agreement provided a framework for the establishment of a Unity Government, consisting of members drawn from both the TFG and the ARS. 

The parties agreed to expand the parliament with an additional 200 seats for ARS-members, as well as with 75 seats allotted to members of the Somali civil society, including women as well as members of the Somali diaspora and business community. A UN-facilitated working group was established in order to develop detailed plans for structures for the Unity Government, which it would submit to the High Level Committee, established through the Djibouti Agreement. 

In order to accommodate the changes necessary in line with this agreement and others, the parties agreed the new provisions would be embedded in the Transitional Federal Charter as amendments. The Transitional Period was extended for an additional two years, starting from August 2009. Thus, the 26 November agreement advanced the Somali peace process through settling part of the incompatibility, but its limitation to the transitional period renders it a partial peace agreement."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/SOM%2020081126.pdf	0	1	0	0	Somalia	SOM
4511996113001	382	Sierra Leone: government	2	Abidjan Peace Agreement	1996-11-30	"Full peace agreement

A peace agreement was signed on 30 November 1996 in Abidjan between the government of Sierra Leone and RUF.

The agreement stipulated a cessation of hostilities and a number of reforms for the armed forces. The Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was to make recommendations for the restructuring of the armed forces and the selection of commanding officers. Rebels could be integrated into these reconstructed forces, but inclusion hinged on combatants being acceptable to certain criteria to be worked out by the Commission. Provisions were also made for the resettlement and rehabilitation of those combatants who were not integrated. To monitor the ceasefire a Joint Monitoring Group comprising the government and RUF and a Neutral Monitoring Group comprising members from the international community were established.

The agreement establishes a Commission for the Consolidation of Peace; basically a verification and compliance mechanism comprised of representatives of RUF and the government. This commission was to establish a number of subcommittees charged with consolidating the peace and instituting programs for the reconstruction of the country. The Commission also had the power to make preliminary legislative drafts necessary for the implementation of the peace agreement.

Political reforms included the restructuring of the National Electoral Commission, and the transformation of the RUF/SL into a legal political party that would enjoy freedom of the press, access to the media and other democratic rights. National resources would be distributed equitably between all citizens and provisions were also made for political reforms to rid the country of extreme poverty and starvation. In order to consolidate the peace, and bring national reconciliation to Sierra Leone, all rebels were granted an amnesty and thereby freed of any possible prosecution for crimes related to the conflict."	1	1997-03-06	On 17 January the RUF accused the government of violating the peace agreement. But the agreement continued to be implemented and some rebels were demobilised.  At the end of February 1997, it was reported that members of the RUF had violated the peace agreement. On 2 March Sankoh was arrested in Nigeria and on 6 March the government stated that they no longer were prepared to wait for a response from Sankoh.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/SiL%2019961130.pdf	1	1	0	1	Sierra Leone	SLE
4511999070701	382	Sierra Leone: government	2	Lomé Peace Agreement	1999-07-07	"Full peace agreement

The Togolese city of Lomé was the venue for the signing of this peace agreement on 7 July 1999. The government of Sierra Leone and RUF both took part, but the AFRC were not included in the talks.

The first point in the agreement was a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities, to be monitored by a committee chaired by UNOMSIL and participated in by the government and RUF. A new national army is to be constructed, drawing on those combatants that fulfill the established criteria for integration. An extensive DDR program is established, with financial payments and benefits for those demobilized and a committee for the purpose of retraining ex-combatants for civilian duties and social reintegration.

The agreement regulated the incompatibility through the establishment of power-sharing arrangements at all levels of government. The leader of the RUF, Colonel Foday Sankoh, was given a seat equivalent to the position of Vice-President. Further the RUF were given one senior cabinet seat, three other cabinet positions and four posts of deputy minister. The AFRC were given the possibility to be included in the holding of public offices. The agreement also established a number of commissions; the Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, the Commission for National Reconstruction and the Commission on Development to monitor the exploitation of natural resources. The RUF leader, Sankoh, was given the chairmanship of these commissions. Also, the establishment of a Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was reaffirmed, but with an amended mandate. Other important political issues were the transformation of RUF into a political party and the parties agreeing to hold elections at the time provided for by the constitution.

Finally, a general amnesty was issued and a program for the voluntary return of refugees and IDP’s was established."	1	2000-02-01	In February 2000, the RUF resistance to the deployment of the UNAMSIL forces led to direct confrontations. The UN increased its support of the Sierra Leonean Government.

The parties agreed that the rule of law would reign supreme through the establishment of pluralistic democracy, human rights and national unity. Political parties should be allowed for under law and the judiciary should be made to be independent. The agreement firmly stated the rejection of ideologies based on ethnicity, religion or intolerance.

To approach the goal of such reconciliation and unity a National Commission on Human Rights was established, and all refugees were to be encouraged to return to take part in the democratic process."	1	1993-08-01	See Arusha Accords.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Rwa%2019930804.pdf	0	1	0	1	Rwanda	RWA

This agreement is the fifth protocol that was included in the Arusha Accords of 1993. The agreement focuses on demobilization of forces and the formation of a new national army.

The agreement regulates all sectors of the armed forces; the military, the police and the gendarmerie. All troops involved in the conflict are to relocate to cantonment points to await demobilization or integration into the stipulated new national army. Quotas are specified for this integration, stating that 60% of the military forces will be government troops and 40% will be rebel troops. The command structure is to be based on an equal quota. The same quotas are applied for integration into the National Gendarmerie; the national police force of Rwanda. The agreement also stipulates the doctrine, training program and other specifications for the entire process of the formation of a new army. The implementation of these modalities, and the general supervision of the final peace agreement, are to be supervised by an Neutral International Force, supplied by the UN.

The demobilization programme agreed upon posits a wide number of activities, such as demobilization allowances according to rank, social reintegration and job opportunities for those demobilized.

The Arusha Accords were signed 4 August 1993. It lasted less than a month - the implementation of the peace agreement was prepared, but never fulfilled. The Arusha Accords comprised a general agreement and six attached protocols that were all combined into a whole to form this comprehensive agreement.

The first point of interest in the agreement was the parties reaffirming the N´Sele Ceasefire Agreement, which instated a Neutral Corridor separating the warring parties from each other. The corridor, and the observance of the ceasefire, was to be monitored by the Neutral Military Observer Group. A unified national army was stipulated, and the government was to contribute 60% of the forces and the FPR 40%. The same formula was applied for the police force, and all other types of uniformed forces. The military pact was of an extensive nature, with military power-sharing also applied to military training schools and other facilities. The combatants that would not be integrated were to become subject to a DDR program which included demobilization allowances and social, economic and educational training.

A power-sharing arrangement was agreed upon in the political sphere to resolve the incompatibility. The president and prime minister were to be chosen through a process of consensus, ministerial portfolios were distributed between all the participating parties (with the FPR receiving five such portfolios) and the seats in the assembly were to be shared according to a similar formula (the FPR being granted 11 seats). The new Prime Minister was to be installed by 10 September. Multiparty general elections were to take place after a 22-month period, during which the power-sharing arrangements would be in force.

Finally, the agreement allowed for repatriation of all Rwandan refugees and the return of internally displaced persons to their homes. The CDR, an extremist party which broke out from the MRND, and which claimed to represent the interests of the Hutu majority, refused to participate in any future Assembly."	1	1993-08-01	The peace agreement ended after less than a month. By the end of August there were renewed outbreaks of violence in Kigali and in Butare. Moreover, the transitional government and legislature were not established on 10 September as the peace agreement stipulated. The implementation never really got started. The UNAMIR troops (deployed in November to facilitate the implementation) declared in December that the conditions necessary to introduce the transitional institutions would be fulfilled by the end of the month. In late December the implementation was however further postponed following disagreement between the political parties on the nomination of representatives to the transitional institutions. In April 1994, a genocide broke out and the peace agreement was never fully implemented.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Rwa%2019930804.pdf	1	1	0	1	Rwanda	RWA

The Honiara Declaration on Peace, Reconciliation and Rehabilitation on Bougainville is a peace process agreement, specifying an end to conflict activity but does not determine the outcome of the incompatibility. 

The declaration was described a package of phased arrangements for the restoration of services on Bougainville according to a timetable. During the first month, a Task force was to be established and the blockade of Bougainville abandoned. In its next phase, the BRA was to disarm and dissolve and a Legal Authority of Bougainville would be established. Both parties would receive amnesty, and all prisoners would be surrendered. 

In total, the implementation of all parts of the agreement was supposed to take three years, with reviews every six months. An international monitoring group was to be invited to help with the implementation. As to the future status of Bougainville, the agreement did not clarify any specific solution, stating instead that the National Minister for Provincial Affairs should determine this on advice from the newly established legal authority in Bougainville."	1	1991-02-01	"When the declaration was published, a war-of-words began.

The signing of the Cotonou agreement should be seen as a considerable move forward in the Liberian peace process. The parties agreed on a number of issues, most importantly on the modalities and specifications for the transitional government that had been set forth early on in the process.

The first point was the establishment of a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by ECOMOG. The troops involved in the fighting were to remain in their locations until the commencement of encampment and subsequent demobilization. The parties expressed their willingness to disarm, and called upon the international community for financial aid for such a process.

The most important deal however was struck when the parties agreed to the composition and mandate of the Transitional Government. This transitional regime would enjoy full authority over the Liberian territory and contained a number of power-sharing arrangements in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The executive would be composed of a five member Council of State, the delegates chosen by ‘prominent Liberians’. The Transitional Assembly would be comprised of delegates from the government (13 members), the NPFL (13 members) and ULIMO (9 members). ULIMO were also granted the right to nominate one delegate to the Supreme Court. Power-sharing was also present in the formation of en Elections Commission, charged with working towards the holding of general elections.

Also, a general amnesty was declared, and a program for the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons was initiated, along with a release of all prisoners of war.

On 9 December 2002 the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) signed a peace accord in Geneva, Switzerland.

The first point in the agreement is a cessation of hostilities, combined with a redeployment of both belligerents’ troops to defensive positions. These defensive positions were agreed upon in a joint commission. The next step in the process was a phased disarmament and demobilizations program, under which the GAM rebels were to place there weapons in prearranged sites and fully disarm within seven months. There was also a partial demilitarization of the Aceh province. Throughout the peace process policing duties and law and order would continue to be the responsibility of the Indonesian police.

The parties further agreed to the acceptance of the NAD law, giving the Aceh province a broad autonomy, but without the authority over policing. The peace process was to be a democratic and inclusive process that would lead up to a democratically elected government for the Aceh province. The parties also agreed that this first settlement would lead to further negotiations, seeing that GAM had not had all of their demands satisfied. An international monitoring committee was established to oversee the process."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ind%2020021209.pdf	1	0	1	0	Indonesia	IDN

The agreement was signed in Helsinki, Finland, on 15 August 2005 under the mediation and facilitation of former Finnish president Marti Ahtisaari.

The agreement stipulated the demobilization and disbandment of GAM’s 3,000 rebel troops and their reintegration into civilian life. All demobilized combatants are given the right to an employment or to appropriate farmlands. The agreement also restricts the presence of government troops in the region, and calls for a withdrawal of all non-organic forces from Aceh. The police force in Aceh was to be retrained, in order to firmly entrench democratic and human rights values in the doctrine of the forces.

The territorial incompatibility was regulated through an agreement on self-governance for Aceh. Aceh will govern itself in all sectors of public affairs except foreign affairs, external defence, national security, monetary and fiscal matters, justice and freedom of religion. The government of Indonesia was charged with agreeing in consultation on international agreements and legislation that affected the Aceh region. Traditional institutions of Aceh were to be reinstated.

Measures were also agreed upon to legalize the formation of Aceh-based political parties, and to hold elections in 2006 and 2009 for the executive and legislative branches of the Acehnese self-governing entity. Agreement was also reached on the sensitive issue of natural resources; 70% of revenue from the exploitation of these resources would be channeled to the Aceh government. The agreement also stipulated the establishment of a Human Rights Court, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a Reintegration Fund. The fund would be used to facilitate the reconstruction of the country and the resettlement of ex-combatants and displaced persons. An Aceh Monitoring Mission was to monitor and verify the implementation of the peace agreement, and would consist of observers from EU and ASEAN countries.

Finally a general amnesty was proclaimed, and a release of political prisoners and detainees was stipulated."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ind%20050815.pdf	1	1	1	1	Indonesia	IDN

It provided for the surrender of the ATTF rebels: to deposit arms and ammunition and surrender all underground activities. In the accord the new left wing government committed itself to take measures for the resettlement and rehabilitation of ATTF personnel; to the eviction of Bengalis, who had arrived after 1971, from the tribal areas; and to the introduction of an inner-line permit system restricting the settlement of Bengalis in Tripura. 

Furthermore, the settlement provided for the inclusion of the tribal majority districts in the Autonomous District Council areas; for the establishment of a village police force under the ADC; and the increase of numbers of seats for the tribal representatives in the ADC. Lastly the parties agreed on several measures to strengthen and protect the cultural heritage of the tribal population such as language, names and important buildings.

In Guwahati, on 20 February 1993, the government of Assam and the government of India signed a peace settlement with the militant Bodo group ABSU; one of the groups fighting for greater group rights for the Bodo tribes in the state of Assam.

The settlement stipulated the bringing overground of all ABSU militants, and their subsequent depositing of arms and disbandment. The government of Assam was to initiate immediate steps for suitable rehabilitation, and also provided ex-gratia payments to the next of kin of those killed during the conflict.

The key provisions of the agreement was the establishment of the Bodoland Autonomous Council, comprising 2000 villages and 25 tea plantations in 8 districts of northern and lower Assam. The council should be comprised of 35 elected members, with five more to be nominated by the Governor of Assam from the underrepresented communities. It should act as an assembly for the autonomous area, and secure the ""social, economic, educational, ethnic and cultural advancement of the Bodos residing therein"". Contrary to what the Bodo delegation demanded the council were not given any autonomy with regard to law and order within this territory.

Two problems were highly visible both in the negotiation and implementation phase of the accord. Firstly, there was no consensus on the Bodo's demographic strength and extension within the area they demanded autonomy for. Secondly, as the Bodo villages were not contiguous the demarcation of the jurisdiction of BAC remained a problem. The accord provided for all villages having a 50 per cent tribal population into the BAC. For the sake of contiguity, even villages with only one per cent tribal population was included. When the time for implementation came the accord was met by stiff resistance from the Assamese population in these areas.The accord was heavily criticized by the hard-line militants within the Bodo- movement. The Bodo Security Force said its was a betrayal of the Bodo cause, and had at the time already resumed the violent campaign for a separate state of Bodoland apart from Assam."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/India%2019930220.pdf	1	0	1	1	India	IND

This peace agreement, part of the renewed Guatemalan peace process, regulated the relationship between the armed forces and civilian authorities, and included far-reaching reforms of the said relationship.

One of the main provisions was that there would be reforms and a restructuring of the different branches of the armed forces. The first point was the restructuring of the police force into a new National Civil Police with a reformed mandate. The new police force should take into account the multi-ethnic character of Guatemala in its recruitment, but it did not assure URNG or the indigenous population any direct influence or participation. Further the army would limit its role to external defence and adjust its doctrine, training, development, size and budget accordingly. The Voluntary Civil Defence Committees (CVDC) and the mobile military police were to be disbanded and never again recreated for the purpose of internal security.

Further, it was specified that there would be a complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the DRC within 9 months. A joint military commission, comprised of the warring parties and the UN/OAU observer groups, would be set up to ensure compliance with the ceasefire and to disarm identified militia groups such as the Mayi-Mayi and Interahamwé. Furthermore, it established the deployment of UN peacekeepers and the formation of a national army made up by government and rebel forces.

A key issue was the organization of inter-Colongese political negotiations. The inter-Congolese dialogue would include the government along with the armed and unarmed political forces of the country, and lead to a democratic transition by general elections.

As in the 1994 agreement FRUD faction rebels became the subject of a DDR program, integrating FRUD faction fighters into the national army, and other FRUD faction members into civilian posts as deemed appropriate for them. Those who had suffered economic losses were to be compensated by the government.

The political provisions included a more far-reaching decentralization of authority and a move towards a more democratic Djibouti. The decentralization reform was supposed to give the provinces a broad autonomy to ensure better management of state affairs. The agreement also contained some reforms to make the political system more free, transparent and accountable, especially in terms of public spending.

Efforts to rebuild the country and encourage refugees and IDP’s to return were also a vital part of the agreement, and all those affected by the conflict were to receive appropriate compensation.

Finally, a general amnesty was issued for FRUD members."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/dji20000207.pdf	1	1	1	1	Djibouti	DJI
5222001051201	379	Djibouti: government	2	Accord de reforme et concorde civile	2001-05-12	"Full peace agreement

After 15 months of negotiations the Djibouti government and the radical wing of the opposition Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) signed a peace accord on 12 May. The accord ended hostilities that were launched at the start of 1990s by FRUD, a rebel movement of the Afars (second largest ethnic group in Djibouti after the Somali-speaking Issa). The agreement reaffirms the earlier agreements of 1994 (signed by the main body of FRUD) and 2000 (signed by the FRUD faction that were party to this agreement).

The agreement stipulated a ceasefire, under which both the FRUD faction's and the government’s troops were to withdraw from the territory they occupied. The rebels were forced to withdraw to specified locations (such as Waddi) to await demobilization or integration into the national army. The government’s troops, in turn, were to relocate to peacetime locations and remain encamped in their barracks. As in the previous agreements between FRUD and the government, FRUD troops are to be integrated into the national army. It is important to note that the integration stipulated under this agreement concerned not only the army, but also assured the FRUD faction that their troops would be incorporated into a restructured police force.

There were three key issues in the political sphere of the agreement; namely the reaffirmation of FRUD’s transformation into a legal political party, further specifications of the nature of the decentralization of authority and the government’s acceptance of multi-party elections. 

A program for the repatriation of refugees and the reconstruction of war affected areas was also agreed upon."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/DJI%2020010512.pdf	1	1	1	1	Djibouti	DJI

During the comprehensive peace negotiations in Dayton, USA, the Croatian government and the Croatian Serbs of Eastern Slavonia (a 'Serb autonomous region' being part of the Serbian Republic of Krajina) concluded an accord providing for the eventual reintegration of the Serb-held Eastern Slavonia into Croatia.

Peace negotiators Peter Galbraith and Thorvald Stoltenberg presented a text of 14 points that the Serbs and the Croatian Government accepted on 12 November.

4841999122901	408	Congo: government	2	Accord de Cessez-le-Feu et de Cessation des Hostilités	1999-12-29	"Partial peace agreement
""Accord de Cessez-le-Feu et de Cessation des Hostilités"" was signed on 29 December 1999 in Brazzaville. The accord follows a previous agreement, ""Accord de Cessation des Hostilités en République du Congo"", which was signed on 16 November 1999. The latter accord does not refer to any political compromises or concessions and was only signed by a handful of militia commanders. It is best viewed as a partial settlement to the conflict and hence, it is not included here as a peace agreement. ""Accord de Cessez-le-Feu et de Cessation des Hostilités"" called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the creation of a creation of a ""comité de suivi mixte et paritaire"" (CDS) to implement the accord. This committee was to oversee the disarmament of the militias, the integration of former fighters into the armed forces and collection of weapons from these groups. The accord also guaranteed the free circulation of people and their goods throughout the country, and allowed for former civil servants to resume their posts. Also stipulated in the accord was the launching of a national dialogue, a ""Dialogue National sans exclusif"". This process was to lead to the drafting of a new constitution and to a series of elections to return the country to normal, multiparty political life."	0	2099-01-01	The spokespersons for the militias were gravely dissatisfied with the implementation of the accord in general, and with the National Dialogue in particular. They criticized the environment in which the Dialogue took place and argued that the terms of the accords were not observed. More specifically, they stated that the CDS never carried out its work of overseeing the accord and that the reorganisation of the public forces was not carried out as envisioned. However, the dialogue did take place, as stipulated in the agreement and in 2002 presidential elections were held. Most of the Cobras have now been integrated into the army, otherwise regularized, or disbanded. Ninjas and Cocoyes have also largely disbanded and returned to civilian life. The UN continued its reintegration programme for former militiamen, which was intended to consolidate the peace. The process was slow, however, due to substantial under funding. In 2002, one of the warring parties who had signed the agreement, the Ntsiloulous, broke the ceasefire and low-intensity clashes continued throughout the year in the Pool region. The Ninjas and the Cocoyes stood by the agreement, however, wherefore the fighting never came close to reaching the levels of the late 1990s.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Con%2019991229.pdf	1	1	0	1	Republic of the Congo	COG

The Famboni Declaration was a peace agreement signed in Famboni, by the central government of Comoros and the separatist leader of the island of Anjouan.The key issue agreed upon was the transformation of the political and territorial structure of the Comoros, granting extensive powers of self-government to the different islands that constitute this small country. The final political structure was unclear though, bearing traits of federal, confederal and autonomy solutions. It was specified that the central government would remain responsible for external defence, religion, nationality, monetary policy and foreign relations; but the exact powers delegated to the islands remained unclear.

The agreement also created a new constitution to be put to the vote at a referendum after the one year transitional period.The agreement was severely criticized by the OAU on the grounds that it contravened the Antananativo Agreement from 1999 (this agreement was never signed by the Anjouan separatists). Also the opposition on both Anjouan and Moroni strongly criticized the agreement that was said to exclude a great majority of the Comorian people and political shareholders."	1	2000-01-01	The agreement was unpopular from the outset, receiving severe criticism from both the internal opposition on the two islands and from the OAU.

8111991102301	300	Cambodia (Kampuchea): government	2	"Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict ""The Paris Agreement"""	1991-10-23	"Full peace agreement
On 23 October the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict was signed between the government of Cambodia and the three groups fighting the government (the Khmer Rouge, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF). The agreement is also referred to as ‘the Paris Agreement’, since it was signed in Paris, France, during a peace conference held by the government of the French Republic.The agreement firstly reaffirms a number of earlier agreements, such as the Framework document of 28 August 1990, the formation of the Supreme National Council (SNC) on 10 September 1990 and the election of Prince Sihanouk as the President of the SNC on 17 July 1991.

A ceasefire is called into place, which ends hostilities between the parties. The ceasefire also stipulates the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Cambodian territory, and the cessation of all military support to the belligerents in the conflict. The parties agreed to demobilize all of their forces before the elections, and to place any units that were not demobilized under the control of the government that would be elected after the transitional period. A new national army was to be formed to the end the conflict. The training and restructuring of the police force was delegated to the UNTAC mission.

One of the most important measures for regulating the incompatibility was the formation of the Supreme National Council which was lead by Prince Sihanouk. This council was the outcome of a power-sharing arrangement between the parties under which power would be split almost equally between the belligerents. The SNC was to be seen as the sole representative of Cambodian sovereignty and authority. The SNC was composed of 6 members of the Cambodian government, 2 members of KPNLF, 1 member of FUNCINPEC and 2 members of the Khmer Rouge (KR). An important issue was the provision to hold free and fair elections at the end of the transitional period. The elections were supposed to end the conflict. Principles for a new constitution were elaborated upon, and would include a strengthening of human rights and democracy.

A substantive role was played by the UN and the UNTAC mission stationed in Cambodia to oversee the ceasefire and the transitional period. See Third Parties for more specifications.

The agreement also stipulated the release of all political prisoners, civilian internees and prisoners of war. Likewise there was an extensive program for the return of refugees and displaced persons, for which the government of Cambodia asked for the assistance of the UN and the international community."	0	2099-01-01	The peace agreement ended at different points for different actors. The Khmer Rouge claimed that the agreement were not implemented according to plan and continued their struggle with increasing intensity from mid-1992. On 5 July 1997 the CPP attacked a faction of FUNCINPEC claiming the group were plotting to overthrow the government. In March 1998, after negotiations involving King Sihanouk, all opposition parties - including the FUNCINPEC rebellious main faction - declared their willingness to follow the Paris Agreement and respect the upcoming elections in 1998.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Cam%2019911023.pdf	1	1	0	1	Cambodia	KHM
5162000082801	287	Burundi: government	2	Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi	2000-08-28	"Full peace agreement 

Despite disagreements on key issues during Arusha negotiations, an agreement was signed on 28 August. Three of the parties signed in September. All in all, 19 parties acceded to the agreement, including the former warring parties CNDD, FROLINA and PALIPEHUTU. However, both the CNDD-FDD and the FNL denounced the peace agreement.

The agreement firstly stipulated a ceasefire and a cessation of all hostile attacks, acts of violence against civilians, the supply of armaments and an end to hostile propaganda. The ceasefire entailed no concessions of territory, and all troops remained ‘in situ’, or were to be encamped in prearranged sites to await demobilization or integration into the new armed forces. A joint ceasefire commission was created in order to monitor and supervise the ceasefire and was composed of government delegates, members of the warring parties, the United Nations, the OAU and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi. See Third Parties for more details on this commission. The encampment of the warring parties was to be followed by a general demobilization for those forces that were not incorporated into the restructured armed forces. The parties agreed to reform the armed forces on the basis of an ethnic quota, stating that the armed forces would be composed of 50% Hutus and 50% Tutsis. The same modality was provided for the security forces, providing an equal proportion of employment vacancies for the ethnic groups within the police force. For those not incorporated into these new branches of the armed forces a demobilization package was created with the purpose of providing socio-professional training to those demobilized

The peace agreement also provided for arrangements for a pre-transition, and then transition, period, which would be followed by democratic elections. The transitional period contained elements of a powersharing arrangement, assuring the signatories and members of the civil society seats in a transitional National Assembly. A created Senate would be elected on an ethnic basis, ensuring ethnic balance in the higher levels of government. A range of procedures for the assembly and the senate were agreed upon, to ensure that no single political or ethnic group could receive a complete domination of the political system. The agreement further contained a number of amendments to the political and judicial system, all with the goal of creating a democratic state with the traits associated with good governance. An Implementation Verification Commission was created to oversee and supervise the implementation of the provisions of the agreement.

The transitional period was to end with elections for the National Assembly, the Presidency and the Senate according to the principles of free and fair elections.

Certain provisions for demobilization were given, the most important being demobilization allowances for all demobilized troops, and a general amnesty applicable to all those who had not commit crimes against humanity or crimes relating to the genocide.

Reconstruction and development, and the return of refugees and displaced persons were important issues in the agreement, and extensive reconstruction programs for economic and social development were formed, as well as an extensive program for the resettling of those uprooted by the conflict.

The agreement also stipulated the creation of a number of commission and committees, charged with the responsibilities of investigate alleged crimes of genocide, explore ways to reach National Reconciliation and to administer ethnic harmony."	0	2099-01-01	None of the signatories took up the fighting or declared the peace agreement invalid. However, it proved impossible to carry out the provisions of the transitional phase, due to intensification in the fighting between the government and the two extremist groups; the CNDD-FDD and the FNL. The fighting between these parties continued immediately after the government had signed the Arusha agreement on 28 August.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Bur%2020000828a.pdf	1	1	0	1	Burundi	BDI

The Accord du Cessez-le-feu entre le Gouvernement de Transition du Burundi et le CNDD-FDD brought the CNDD-FDD into the Arusha Accords process, which the rebel group had opposed in 2000. Most of the implementation process was specified under the Arusha Accords, and the agreement can be seen as a continuation of a process begun under that agreement.

The conflict behavior of the parties is regulated through the establishment of a ceasefire, which stipulates a withdrawal of forces from the frontline to assembly areas. The ceasefire further entailed the release of all prisoners, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and a cessation of all hostile acts, both practical and verbal. A joint commission, comprised of the warring parties and the African mission was set up to implement and verify the ceasefire.

Further, rebel troops are to be integrated into the national army, or be demobilized. The modalities for these actions are specified in the Arusha Accords from the year 2000. CNDD-FDD forces are to integrate into both the army and the security forces. The agreement reiterates the need for reintegration and rehabilitation programs.

The incompatibility is regulated through allowing the CNDD-FDD to become a legal and valid political party, and through allowing them to take part in a power-sharing arrangement within the Burundian political structure. The structure of this power-sharing arrangement, and other outstanding issues are to be agreed upon at a later stage in negotiations, but will be in the form of an inclusive transitional government."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Bur%2020021202.pdf	1	1	0	1	Burundi	BDI
5162003100801	287	Burundi: government	2	The Pretoria Protocol on Political, Defence and Security Power Sharing in Burundi	2003-10-08	"Partial peace agreement

The government of Burundi and the CNDD-FDD signed this agreement on 8 October 2003, to resolve some of the outstanding issues that were listed, but not regulated, in the agreement reached on 2 December 2002.

The agreement contained no ceasefire arrangements, seeing that these issues had already been resolved. The key issues were instead power-sharing arrangements in the political and military spheres.

Concerning the military forces the agreement specifies a 60/40 quota of General Staff and Officer Corps to be shared between the government and the CNDD-FF. The quota for the rank and file is to be agreed upon by the integrated General Staff. A similar quota is applied for the police force, with 65% for the transitional government, and 35% for the CNDD-FDD. The new police force would be guided by the principles of inclusion and integration and ethnicity was to be balanced. The Gendarmerie would be treated as part of the army. Elements of the Gendarmerie may be deployed to either the new defense or police forces. Militias would be disarmed according to the December 2002 Ceasefire Agreement under the supervision of the African Mission. The parties also agreed on the establishment of a Ministry of Intelligence under the Presidency. The composition of the Ministry would give the government 65% representation and the CNDD-FDD 35% representation, and it would be ethnically balanced in the same manner as the police force.In the political sphere extensive powersharing arrangements were formed, with CNDD-FDD participation at most levels of government. The main provisions in this sphere were that the CNDD-FDD secured four ministerial posts, one of which is that of Minister of State. CNDD-FDD will also have the posts of Second Vice President and Deputy Secretary General and 15 members in the National Assembly and at provincial and local government level, three Governors, 30 Administrators and five Advisors. In addition the CNDD-FDD secured a 20% representation in Burundian public enterprises; they were given two ambassadorships and six advisors’ posts within the Diplomatic Corps.

Other outstanding issues were to be discussed at a later stage."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Bur%2020031008.pdf	1	1	0	0	Burundi	BDI

On 2 November a partial peace agreement, solving the outstanding issues of the 8 October agreement, was signed in Pretoria between CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) and the government.The agreement reaffirmed the ceasefire agreement signed on 2 December 2002 and called for the continuation of the process of cantonment of the military. The specifications for the integration of CNDD-FDD forces into the Burundian armed forces were reaffirmed, providing the CNDD-FDD with power-sharing arrangements in the military sphere (see 2003-08-10 for further details regarding the integration). A detailed plan for military restructuring, cantonment and demobilization was also drawn up in the form of a forces technical agreement.

Further it was stipulated that the transitional government of Burundi would be reconstituted within three weeks following the agreement to include the CNDD-FDD. The CNDD-FDD would also be transformed into a political party, and its members would receive temporary immunity. Another important political issue was the indication from the CNDD-FF that they would not be able to participate in the transitional senate, and that this complication would be discussed before the elections.

The parties also agreed to call for a national and inclusive dialogue to bring the conflict to a speedy end. Finally there would be established an International Criminal Tribunal and a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission in order to deal with war criminals and the process of national reconciliation."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Bur%2020031102.pdf	1	1	0	1	Burundi	BDI

One should view this agreement as the finalization of a process that begun with the Arusha Accords in 2000.

The Global Ceasefire agreement reaffirmed the earlier agreements reached, and thus provided the CNDD-FDD with extensive powersharing arrangements in both the military/security sector and the political sector. Further details can be found in the partial peace agreements leading up to this finalized deal, but the most important provisions granted to the CNDD-FDD were a 40% share in the army, a 35% share in the police, several ministerial portfolios and other government posts and 20% of Burundian national enterprises.

On 18 June 2006 the government and the last remaining rebel group, Palipehutu-FNL, led by Agathon Rwasa, signed a peace process agreement and ceasefire agreement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This was the first ever agreement signed by the Palipehutu-FNL and the government. The agreement contained nine articles and two annexes and negotiations took place between 29 May and 18 June.
 
The parties agreed to stop all hostilities and start negotiations on a comprehensive ceasefire. From the start of the ceasefire the agreement provided for provisional immunity of members of the Palipehutu-FNL and for the relese of political prisoners and prisoners of war. Regarding the Defence and Security Forces they were to act in a manner fostering national reconciliation and national unity, they were to be subject to the national agenda in Burundi for democracy, peace, justice, reconciliation, security, stability, development and prosperity. 

Regarding the incompatibility Palipehutu-FNL was allowed to become a political party after the separation of the political and the military branch of the movement. A Truth, Forgiveness and Reconciliation Commission would be formed by all components of the Burundian society with the aim of rewriting the Burundian history and establish a social contract.

The Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement between the Palipehutu-FNL and the government of Burundi was signed in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on 7 September 2006 following negotiations since the end of May, which also lead up to the signing of the ""Agreement of Principles Towards Lasting Peace, Security and Stability"", a peace process agreement of which this agreement is the final outcome. 

The agreement consisted of six articles and four annexes.
 
The agreement stipulated a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities, to be monitored and verified by the JVMM (Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism), which was to be consisted of the AU, the UN and the warring parties. This mechanism was responsible for the assembly of Palipehutu-FNL combatants and their demobilisation, creation of criteria for integration into the army, or the reintegration into society of ex-combatants.
 
Regarding the incompatibility the parties agreed to cease all propaganda between the parties and the incitement of ethnic hatred both within and outside the country. One of the main obstacles for Palipehutu-FNL with previous peace processes in the country has been reform of the Burundian armed forces. Therefore one of the main points of the agreement (which to a certain degree regulated the incompatibility) was to further outline the stipulated reform of the Defense and Security forces, a process that was begun in the peace process agreement signed in June the same year. 

Other important points in the agreement were the granting of provisional immunity to Palipehutu-FNL combatants, which was implemented in November 2006, the release of prisoners and calls for the repatriation of all refugees and IDPs to their places of residence."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Bur%2020060907.pdf	1	0	0	1	Burundi	BDI

The agreement was signed during a one-day summit involving heads of state in the Great Lakes region and other stakeholders in the peace process. The summit was presided over by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Chairperson of the regional Burundi Peace Initiative.
 
In the agreement, Palipehutu-FNL acknowledged that its name was prohibited by the Burundian Constitution and agreed to change it in order to be able to register as a political party. The government agreed to integrate Palipehutu-FNL into the political process and to grant government positions to 33 of its senior members. The agreement thus regulated the incompatibility by removing the final obstacles for the transformation of Palipehutu-FNL into a political party and granting it participation in government. 

The parties also reaffirmed their commitment to the demobilisation process, monitored by the joint verification monitoring mechanism (JVMM), and release of political prisoners outlined in the 2006 agreement."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/BUI%2020081204.pdf	1	1	0	1	Burundi	BDI
3461995121401	389	Bosnia and Herzegovina: Serb	1	The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Dayton Agreement)	1995-12-14	"Full peace agreement

The comprehensive peace negotiations starting on 1 November in Dayton, USA, led up to the signing of a peace agreement. The 'Dayton Agreement' was based on the accords reached in Geneva and in New York in September. See Negotiations for further details.

The agreement reaffirmed earlier ceasefire arrangements from September 14 and October 15, and also stipulated further withdrawals of military forces. The active armed forces were to withdraw from territory that was to fall under the political control of other political entities, and a Zone of Separation was created, disengaging the warring parties from each other. This Zone of Separation, and the ceasefire in general, was to be monitored by IFOR and a joint military commission created for that purpose. The UN group UNPROFOR was to withdraw and be replaced by IFOR (the Implementation Force under NATO control. For more information on IFOR’s and UNPROFOR’s mission, consult Third Parties to this agreement. Further, the agreement contained a number of arrangements regarding restrictions on heavy weapons, the disbandment of paramilitary groups and the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from the disputed territory.

The key agreement regulating the incompatibility was the amendment of the Bosnia and Herzegovina territorial and political structure, creating a new entity composed of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska; a Serb dominated territory. The Federation was to maintain its powers in the spheres of foreign policy, monetary policy and international obligations (among other things), whilst the entities received far-reaching provisions for self-government. Amongst other things the Republika Sprska received powers over law enforcement, the power to establish relationships with neighboring states and the power to make its laws. Yet it was agreed that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Bosnia was to be upheld. The new constitution entailed power-sharing arrangements at the level of central government, assuring the Serbs one third of delegates in the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives and a tripartite Presidency composed of one Serb, one Croat and one Bosniak. It was also agreed that elections were to be held throughout the territory under the auspices of an OSCE presence.

Deals were also struck regarding the strengthening of human rights, and the return of refugees and displaced persons. The return of refugees was ensured through a comprehensive program on their safe return, protection and judicial rights. Returnees were awarded with an amnesty (had they not committed serious violations) and were given repatriation assistance. Furthermore a fund was set up to facilitate the return of the displaced, and guidelines for the repossession of property or reimbursement were drawn up."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/BoH%2019951121.pdf	1	1	1	1	Bosnia and Herzegovina	BIH
3461994030101	398	Bosnia and Herzegovina: Croat	1	The Washington Agreement	1994-03-01	"Partial peace agreement

The belligerents in the Bosnia and Herzegovina – Croatian conflict signed the peace agreement in Washington on 1 March 1994, creating a framework agreement for a solution to the territorial conflict, creating a federation of Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a preliminary confederation between the Federation and Croatia.

The agreement contains an arrangement of disengagement for the transitional period, specifying that the armed forces of the disputing parties are to disengage to a safe distance from each other. All foreign armed forces are to leave the territory immediately. It is further agreed that after the transitional period the entities will form a unified military command for the national defense of the Federation.

The key issue of the agreement, which regulated the incompatibility, was the creation of a Federation, comprised of both Bosniak and Croat dominated territorial entities. The arrangements reached created a Federation in which Bosniaks and Croats shared power equally through a rotating presidency based on ethnicity, an equal representation of the two ethnic groups in the assembly and an equal proportion of judges in the judicial branches. Further, the agreement stipulated a division of the Federation into cantons that would have far-reaching self-governing powers in sectors such as policing, culture, education and taxation. These cantons were based on a system of ethnic dominance, creating Bosnian and Croat cantons throughout the territory. The central government would have exclusive responsibility for foreign affairs, national defense, economic policy and other issues not delegated to the cantonal governments. The emerging federal institutions were to operate parallel during the interim period.

The agreement also provided for a full repatriation of all refugees and internally displaced persons. Furthermore, a preliminary agreement was made between President Izetbegovic and President Tudjman, providing for the creation of an eventual loose confederation between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The peace agreement was further specified and implementation initiated in May. On 11 May, the Vienna Agreement divided the Federation into eight cantons and determined the composition of the interim federation government. On 31 May, the assembly of the Bosnian Federation elected an interim president (Kresimir Zubak, Croat) and a vice-president (Ejup Ganic, Bosniak). A joint government of (the old) Bosnia and Herzegovina and the (new) Federation was appointed in late June. The federal elections were scheduled after six months. On 4 May 1995, the inaugural session of the Federation's Constituent Assembly took place. On 10 November 1995, comprehensive peace negotiations concerning several of the Yugoslav conflicts took place in Dayton, USA. Tudjman and Izetbegovic then signed an accord reinforcing the 1994 federation agreement. The new agreement included a provision for the unification of the divided city of Mostar as the federal capital."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/BoH%2019940301.pdf	1	1	1	1	Bosnia and Herzegovina	BIH
7711997120201	322	Bangladesh: Chittagong Hill Tracts	1	Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord	1997-12-02	"Full peace agreement

A full peace agreement was signed in Dhaka on 2 December 1997 between the National Committee on the Chittagong Hill Tracts, representing the government of Bangladesh, and the JSS rebels.

The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and instead directly dealt with other military issues and political incompatibilities. The JSS rebels are to completely disarm, and are to be reintegrated into normal civilian life. In order to provide such rehabilitation into normal life JSS members and their families are given a lump sum of money. Also, JSS members that were employed in the state administration were allowed to be reinstated in their former positions. After the rehabilitation of all JSS members the government troops were to withdraw to permanent military installations in order to normalize the situation. Regarding internal security (police) the created regional council was given the powers over these forces.

The main provision in the accord was the creation of a CHT regional council with a range of autonomous responsibilities, where the chairman was to enjoy the rank of a state minister. 15 of 22 seats in the regional council, including the chairman, were reserved for tribal leaders, thus guaranteeing tribal control over traditional land. Changes in Bangladesh law were required to enable the establishment of the council, but anticipating criticism or misrepresentation of the accord, the issue of the sovereignty and integrity of Bangladesh was explicitly recognized. The transitional period following the signing of the treaty was to end with the withdrawal of the Bangladesh army from the region by the beginning of 2001.A general amnesty was given to all members of the JSS, as well as members of Shanti Bahini in return for surrender of their arms.

Further, a land reform was enacted in order to redistribute land between the Chittagong Hill Tribes and Bengali settlers and to solve disputes between these two groups. A number of funds and loan schemes were set up to facilitate the growth of economic enterprises, such as rubber plantations. A deal was also struck regarding internal refugees and their return to the Hill Tracts, under which the JSS was to cooperate in every aspect with the government. India was also involved in this repatriation of refugees, since many refugees had relocated to the Indian state of Tripura. See Third Parties for further comments.

The government's main opposition; the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) rejected the accord, saying it was against the unitary constitution and the interest of the Bengali-speaking settlers. On the other side at least three smaller groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts; the Hill Students' Federation, the Hill People's council and the Hill Women's council challenged at the time JSS' role as the sole representative of the tribal people. Former associates to the JSS/SB leadership have later formed the United People's Democratic Front (UPDF), which has continued a struggle for full autonomy. The amnesty was not extended to army and police personnel, but there was no commitment in the accord that past human rights violations by the law-enforcement personnel or Bengali settler groups close to the army."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ban%2019971202.pdf	1	0	1	1	Bangladesh	BGD
5401989062201	327	Angola: government	2	The Gbadolite declaration on Angola	1989-06-22	"Peace process agreement

The Gbadolite Declaration was signed in Zaire on 22 June 1989 between the government of Angola and the UNITA movement. The agreement outlined a process which would lead up to an agreement for a definitive peace in Angola.

The agreement stipulates a ceasefire that will be effective from 24 June 1989, and a cessation of all hostilities.

Further a ‘mixed commission’ is formed, with the responsibility of implementing the plan for National Reconciliation. What this plan of National Reconciliation actually entails is not specified in the agreement itself."	1	1989-08-24	There were frequent accusations of violations of the ceasefire from both sides, and no agreement could be reached concerning a key provision of the accord: did Savimbi agree to go into exile or did he merely accept that while he would not be part of a two-year transitional coalition government, he intended to lead UNITA in the multi-party elections which they demanded? The full terms of the accord were interpreted differently by each party and on 24 August 1989, Savimbi announced a resumption of hostilities.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ang%2019890622.pdf	1	0	0	1	Angola	AGO
5401991053101	327	Angola: government	2	The Bicesse Agreement	1991-05-31	"Peace process Agreement

The Bicesse Accords were signed in Lisbon, Portugal, on 31 May 1991, and was a comprehensive peace agreement signed by the government of Angola and UNITA under the mediation of Portugal. The agreement accepted as binding a number of other documents, most importantly the Protocol of Estoril, a ceasefire agreement, the Fundamental Principles for the Establishment of Peace in Angola and the Concepts for Resolving the Issues Still Pending between the Government of the People’s Republic of Angola and UNITA.

The first issue in the agreement was the establishment of a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities between the government and UNITA. The ceasefire covered the entire territory and entailed that the parties would refrain from importing lethal equipment, cease all types of attacks and sabotage and stop the spreading of hostile propaganda. The cease-fire was to be monitored by a joint commission, comprised of the two warring parties and a number of third party actors. See Third Parties for more information on this Joint Political-Military Commission.

Further, the agreement stipulated reforms of the military and security sector, creating an integrated army and a new police force. In the military sector the agreement stipulated that both parties would contribute 20 000 troops each to the new armed forces. In the security sector vacancies within the police force would be guaranteed for UNITA members in order to build confidence between the parties. The forces that are not integrated into the new army are to be demobilized and reintegrated into civilian life.

The agreement regulated the incompatibility through allowing UNITA to become a legal political party and through agreeing to hold elections in a multi-party democracy. UNITA was to become a political party, and freely take part in political activities now allowed under a revised constitution for Angola. An elections process was to be held in which the people would vote for a new president and a National Assembly. Political rights were extended, such as the freedom of expression and freedom of association. The authority of the central administration was extended to include the entire Angolan territory.

The implementation of the peace agreement became the responsibility of a joint political-military commission, comprised of the warring parties and third party actors. See Third Parties for further specifications. All civilian and military prisoners were to be released as a consequence of the agreement. The question of the return of exiles was to be discussed in the joint political-military commission."	1	1992-10-01	Presidential and legislative elections took place as scheduled on 29-30 September 1992. International observers judged the conduct of the elections to have been free and fair. However, when the preliminary results indicated that MPLA had obtained a majority of sears in the new National Assembly, Savimbi demanded an inquiry into the alleged electoral irregularities. On 5 October UNITA withdrew from the new national army, FAA. On 17 October the official election results were announced, with dos Santos receiving 49,6% of the votes. Following this announcement violence erupted throughout the country.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ang%2019910531.pdf	1	1	0	1	Angola	AGO
5401994112001	327	Angola: government	2	The Lusaka Protocol	1994-11-20	"Full peace agreement

The Lusaka Protocol, the text being agreed upon on 15 November but not signed until 20 November, was a comprehensive peace agreement signed by both warring parties in Lusaka, Zambia, under the mediation of the United Nations. The agreement aimed to implement and to some extent amend the earlier Bicesse Accords of 1991.

The agreement reinstated the ceasefire from 1991, but contained some important amendments. Among other things this ceasefire agreement included the withdrawal of UNITA forces from specific locations to allow for a UN monitoring and verification presence in these areas. UNITA forces would withdraw to encampment areas, while government forces, in turn, would remain ‘in situ’. Regarding the military the agreement reaffirms the provisions of the Bicesse Accords, meaning that there will be a proportionate integration of UNITA forces into the new national army. The agreement amends the earlier deal on the police forces, stipulating a specific number of UNITA troops that will become police officers in the new police force. A demobilization program is created under which military forces are to be demobilized and integrated into civilian society, within the framework of a national social reintegration program to be undertaken by both parties with the assistance of the international community. The cease-fire, the formation of the new armed forces and the demobilization would be monitored and verified by a joint commission and the UN. See Third Parties for further specifications.

The incompatibility was regulated under a framework for National Reconciliation, which entailed a powersharing arrangement between the two warring factions. In practice this meant that UNITA were to participate in all levels of government, and that the movement was given certain ministerial portfolios, diplomatic missions, governorships and assured participation in the National Assembly. The framework of National Reconciliation also entailed promises to adhere to the rule of law, the censorship of hostile propaganda and an attempt to speed up the electoral process. Also, there was a decentralization of authority, bestowing provinces with more far-reaching self-governing powers in fields such as taxation, economy and administration.

The agreement also provided UNITA with a formal amnesty for crimes committed during the conflict, and supplied the UNITA party and political leaders with ‘appropriate’ housing."	1	1998-12-01	Implementation of the Lusaka Accord proved to be difficult. UNITA joined the legislature and executive in 1997, but Savimbi stayed away from Luanda. Low-level skirmishes continued throughout the period and new UN sanctions were imposed on UNITA. There were growing indications that UNITA was not disarming properly, and on 31 August 1998 its participation in government was suspended. The accord complete collapsed in December the same year, as the government forces launched major offensives in the central highlands.	http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ang%2019941120.pdf	1	1	1	1	Angola	AGO
5402002040401	327	Angola: government	2	Memorandum of Understanding or Memorandum of Intent	2002-04-04	"Full peace agreement (reaffirmation)

The Memorandum of Understanding or Memorandum of Intent is best understood as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol, dealing with outstanding issues and deals that had not yet been implemented. The agreement reaffirms the commitments and obligations of the parties under the Lusaka Protocol, but amends certain deals reached under that agreement.

The agreement reaffirms a ceasefire and the withdrawal of UNITA troops to quartering locations for demobilization and integration into the national army. The agreement specifies the exact numbers of troops to be integrated into the new military and police forces, including high-level posts such as generals and commanding officers. It also reaffirms the provisions for demobilized troops to be integrated into normal social life and draws up a timetable for the final demobilization of these forces. A mixed commission is created to oversee the last stages of demobilization and reintegration of the demobilized troops. The agreement finally reaffirms the UN presence and its mission in Angola. See Third Parties in Lusaka Protocol (1994) for further details on this mission.

The incompatibility is regulated through the agreements reached in the Lusaka Protocol of 1994, with UNITA participation in all levels of government through the appointment to high-ranking posts and ministerial portfolios.

The formal amnesty issued under the Lusaka Protocol is also reaffirmed."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ang20020404.pdf	1	0	1	1	Angola	AGO
5402005080101	387	Angola: Cabinda	1	Memorandum of Understanding on Peace and National Reconciliation in Cabinda province	2006-08-01	"Partial peace agreement 

The Memorandum of Understanding on Peace and National Reconciliation in Cabinda province was signed after some months of much debated negotiations. Antonio Bento Bembe, who signed the agreement as a representative of CFD (Cabinda Forum for Dialogue) was not acknowledged as a legitimate negotiator by the main body of CFD. The unified FLEC split along former FAC-Renovada lines, with the former rejecting Bembe, saying that he had in fact been dismissed of his functions in the organisation already in February, and the latter supporting him. 

The agreement included provisions for a ceasefire, demilitarization of the CFD controlled areas and a reduction in the number of Angolan armed forces in Cabinda. 

The incompatibility was regulated by the installation of a local government with political and economical powers under the control of the central government in Luanda. Cabinda would have a ""special status"". Exactly what that status would be was not yet determined. However, it was clear that FLEC would get the right to name a government minister without portfolio, three deputy ministers (petroleum, interior and forestry), a deputy governor and some deputy provincial dictatorships. In Angola's state oil company, Sonangol, it would get two non-executive directors, a deputy director for Cabinda and three administrative advisers. 

The accord also stipulated a blanket amnesty to the rebels, and the reinsertion of the former rebels into society."	0	2099-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Ang%2020060801po.pdf	1	0	1	1	Angola	AGO
7001993030701	333	Afghanistan: government	2	Islamabad accord	1993-03-07	"Partial peace agreement 

A number of warring factions and the government of Afghanistan signed the Islamabad Accord on 7 March 1993.

The agreement stipulated an immediate ceasefire, and a permanent cessation of hostilities as soon as a new cabinet for Afghanistan had been put into place. A joint commission comprised of all of the signatory factions and the Organization of the Islamic Conference was created in order to monitor the ceasefire and the permanent cessation of hostilities.

One of the most important issues agreed upon in the accord was the formation of a 16-member defense council, composed of two delegates each from all of the eight signatory factions. The defense council was given the mandate to create a new national army, and to ensure the submission of the armed forces to the said council. Also, the defense council would be responsible for taking control of the heavy weapons deployed around Kabul.

The most important regulation of the incompatibility was the creation of a powersharing arrangement in the form of a transitional government (with a mandate for 18 months) in which Rabbani would remain as President and under which Hekmatyar (Hez-I-Islami) would assume the office of Prime Minister. The Cabinet was to be formed through consultations between the signatory parties in the time following the agreement. Further the agreement outlined the divisions of power between the Prime Minister and the President.Also, the parties agreed to hold elections not later than 18 months following on 29 December 1992. The elections process would be implemented by an independent Elections Commission, comprised of delegates from the warring parties. The goal of this process was to create a Grand Constituent Assembly that in turn would form and ratify a new constitution for Afghanistan.

The accord also contained provisions for the release of all Afghan detainees and prisoners held by the different parties to the conflict. Steps were also taken to consolidate the control of the Afghan state over banking and currency issues."	1	1993-01-01		http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/fullpeace/Afg%2019930307.pdf	1	1	0	1	Afghanistan	AFG

The Jalalabad Accord was signed in Jalalabad on 20 May 1993, between nine warring factions in the Afghan conflict. The agreement aimed to settle the power-struggle that lingered on between Hekmatyar (Hesb-I-Islami) and President Rabbani despite the Islamabad Accord signed on 7 March the same year.

The accord stipulated a permanent ceasefire, which came into force on 23 May, and was to be monitored by a multiparty commission.

The main provision of the agreement was a further specification of the powersharing agreement reached in the Islamabad Accord. The new Afghan Cabinet was to include two ministers each from the nine signatory factions, with Rabbani remaining as President and Hekmatyar assuming the post of Prime Minister. Joint commissions were created to manage the most pressing issues; the control of the ministries of the interior and defense. Other sources say that it was agreed that the President would control the ministry of defense, and the Prime Minister the ministry of the interior. After two months the Mujahideen commanders would elect permanent ministers for interior and defense portfolios. Agreement was also reached, once again, on the establishment of an Electoral Commission which was charged with the task of setting up elections within 18 months."	0	2099-01-01			1	1	0	0	Afghanistan	AFG

On May 24 the government of Afghanistan and the Hezb-I-Islami signed a peace agreement aimed at settling the dispute between these two major factions in the Afghan conflict.

The agreement contained a ceasefire, that aimed to end the current fighting and to restore nationwide peace in the territory of Afghanistan. Following this deal, Hezb-I-Islami forces joined the government troops in their struggle against the Taleban insurgents. The agreement also contained reforms of the military and security sector, with the goal of setting up a national and Islamic army of Afghanistan, and of creating Islamic security forces for deployment throughout the country. 

The powersharing arrangements from the 1993 peace deals were further elaborated upon, ending with Hekmatyar gaining the post of Prime Minister in a transitional government. Also, Hekmatyar’s group (Hezb-I-Islami) were given the highly sought after posts of minister of finance and minister of defense. Further it was agreed that elections would be held and that an elected government would be put in charge of the country as soon as possible. It was also stated that a future government would be based on the foundations of a genuine Islamic order and Islamic principles.

On 26 June Hekmatyar was sworn in as Prime Minister, and a new government under his leadership was announced on 3 June."	1	1996-09-28	Some of the provisions in the accord was implemented. On 26 June Hekmatyar was sworn in as Prime Minister, and a new government under his leadership was announced on 3 June. When the Taleban forces captured Kabul in late September 1996, the coalition government was ousted, and they did not manage to stay united during the continuation of the civil war.		1	1	0	0	Afghanistan	AFG
