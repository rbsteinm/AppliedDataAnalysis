                                 <p>The United Nations often gets criticised for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society has often been questioned. The UN exist since 1945, although until today the amount of conflicts around the world has not significantly diminished, does this mean that the UN is inefficient ? The Israelo-Palestinian conflict is allmost as old as the UN and no Peace Agreements (PA) could completely stop it as of today, so does the efforts made through the UN organization are worth the results ? Such a question would request more than a statistical study to be answered. Hence, we will focus on studying the impact of the UN in the domain of conflict resolution.
                                 	<br/>
                                 	Our study aims at giving an objective analysis of the impact of UN peace agreements on the evolution of conflicts around the world. We present the results of our analysis as a data story. Information relative to both conflicts and peace treaties are displayed on a world map in order to get an insight on the impact they have on one another.
                                 	<br/>To perform this, we used the UCDP dataset which provides information about the conflicts from 1945 to 2016 and peace agreements from 1975 to 2011.</p>

                                <p><center>In this first part, we will study the different armed conflicts that figured in the UCDP database we studied. UCDP defines an armed conflict as a contested incompatibility that concerns a government and/or a territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year. UCDP registered the conflicts from 1945 to 2016.</p>
   
                                The dataset is composed of 280 different conflicts, from which 60 benefited from at least one peace agreement. We will go into further details about the definition of a peace agreement in the next part of this story.</p>
    
                                The main purpose of our project is to analyse the effect of the peace agreements that tried to solve these conflicts. Then, an observation on how the UN peace agreements performed in comparaison with the peace agreements where other actors were involved.</center></p>

The peaks are in 1946 (this corresponds to the first Indochina war), 1948 (which corresponds to the first Arab-Israeli war and the conflict for the independence of Burma). The last peak we notice is in 2015 and it corresponds to the beginning of several conflicts involving IS.</p>
  
                                 When looking at the number of conflicts that benefited from at least one peace agreement, we notice that most of them began between the 1960s and the 1990s.</p>

                                Another interesting fact is that less than 10% of the conflicts were situated in the Middle East, although it is known to be a region with a lot of tensions.</p>

                                We observe that the distributions are not the same across the regions. A large proportion of conflicts that took part in Europe or in Africa benefited from one or several peace agreements whereas there is almost no peace agreements in the Middle East or in Asia. Indeed, looking at the distribution, more than 50% of the conflicts that benefited from at least one peace agreement are located in Africa whereas 30% of the conflicts that did not benefit from a peace agreement took place in Africa.</p>
                                Furthermore, we notice that 33% of african conflicts received a peace agreement, 25% in Europe, but only 7% in the Middle East.</p>

The distribution for the conflicts solved by the UN is more centered on Africa and Americas compared to conflicts that were solved by other entities.

                                <p>Obviously, this goes from the most executive agreement to the least executive agreement, although it does not translate the power of a Peace Agreement. Most peace agreements are partial peace agreements.</p>
                            Peace Process agreements are generally agreements that are signed at the begginning of a conflict and call for future peace agreements. The distribution of peace agreements depending on their executive power does not change much whether the UN is involved or not.</p>

                                <p>The Peace Agreements treating the conflict between Iran and Iraq could never establish peace. Each of the 12 agreements were signed in 1975. Despite the first agreements, that was signed by The Shah of Iran and SADDAM HUSSEIN, all of them were signed by the same two representatives of Iran and Iraq, respectively by ABBAS-ALI KHALATBARY, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iran and SAADOUN HAMADI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq. These agreements that were active in 1975, were then terminated between 1975 and 1980 until they were reactivated. Although the agreements were reactivated in 1980. Conflicts between Iran and Iraq did not stop in 1980, hence we can consider those agreements as complete failures.</p>The Republic of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front were in conflict from 1990 to 1994 when the revolutionnaries became the ruling political party. Six agreements were signed between 1992 and 1993. The five first agreements were signed to provide partial peace and the last one in august 1993 was supposed to provide full peace to the region. None of the agreements provided for the holding of national talks to solve incompatibility and for the integration of rebels into civil service. In April 1994, a genocide broke out and the peace agreements were never fully implemented. The armed wing of the Rwandese Patriotic front ended the genocide in 1994.</p>
                                The agreement to solve the governmental incompatibility between Namibia and South Africa was signed in 1978 and lasted two months. The agreement contained provisions for political incompatibilities leading to independence for Namibia, justice provisions with the return of refugees and release of political prisoners and behavior regulations such as (ceasefire, withdrawal of foreign forces and demobilisation of local armies).
                                </p>The agreement covered indigenous rights and culture and strengthened the position of the indigenous people in Mexico. The accord was never implemented and thus further peace talks that were planned in September the same year were suspended by EZLN. No exact date for the ending of the peace accord has been found.</p>

                                <h3>Insight on the Peace Agreements</h3>
                                 <p>Each peace agreement is defined by a few charateristics for each type of political provision (a provision is a clause in legal instrument). Below we give details about the most recurring clauses.</p><h6> Regulation of warring parties behavior</h6><p> Most peace agreements that contain behavioral clauses provide for a ceasefire and the disarmement of foreign forces. Two kinds of agreements were never terminated. The ones which provided for the creation of a new national army or the integration of rebels into the army and the withdrawal of foreign forces.
                                 </p><h6>Regulation of governmental incompatibilities</h6><p> 72% of the peace agreements concern governmental incompabilities. Peace agreements that provide governmental provisions mostly provide for elections and electoral reforms for rebel integration into the interim government. The main difference that can be observed between UN agreements and non UN agreements is that the UN agreements usually provide provisions for an interim government and elections while non UN agreements msotly only provide provisions for an election.</p><h6>Regulation of territorial incompatibilities</h6><p>Territorial conflicts are mostly treated by peace agreements with clauses about the demarcation of a border or the government granting the disputed region to the other warring party.</p>

                                 <p>Peace agreement usually contain a clause to regulate justice issues, it can be the return of refugees, the release of prisoners, an Amnesty or the concept of National Reconciliation. The most recurring clause is the release of prisoners.</p>
                                  The UN being involved in the negociations of a peace agreement generaly increases the chances of including a justice clause.</p>

                                In this part, we will explore if the peace agreements where the United Nations acted as a third party performed better than the peace agreements where the UN did not act. </p>

                                <h5>After performing a propensity score matching on the Peace Agreements (detail of the method available in the notebook)</h5>
                                <p>Our previous analysis was quite naive as we saw on the earlier part about the peace agreements that they are not equally dristributed accross the two classes that are UN and not UN.</p>
                                In order to solve this problem, we decided to perform a propensity score matching among the PAs, having the UN involvment as a treatment. To do so, we matched the 68 UN peace agreements using a propensity score mathing algorithm (you can check our notebook for further details).</p>
                                After these peace agreements are matched we have that only 30% of the agreements that did not include the UN ended. With this analysis, we could think that the UN is performing worst than the other 3rd parties. But it is important to remember that we matched the PAs according to the caracteristics of the peace agreements, not the caracteristics of the conflicts. This means our analysis is still biased as we saw in the first part of this data story that the UN solved conflicts that were more deadly than the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                Let's perform the matching on the conflicts as well to conclude our analysis with an even less naive analysis.</p>

                                <h5>When matching on the conflicts that the UN solved</h5>
                                 <p>We observed in the first part that the conflicts that the UN solved were more deadly and that they often started because of a governmental incompatibility. Furthermore, we studied in the peace agreement part that a governmental incompatibility conflict is way harder to solve than other conflicts. In order for the analysis to be more fair, we will match the peace agreements so that they are only on the same conflicts as the ones the UN solved. This results in 68 peace agreements for each parts.</p>
                                 When matching on the conflicts , we observe that 42% of the conflicts solved by another 3rd party than the UN failed. This is way higher than the fail rate of the UN that is of 33%.</p>
                                 When matching on the conflicts, we observe that the UN peace agreements are way more stable than the ones performed by other 3rd parties. Indeed, we observed in the previous parts that the UN was taking care of a larger part of deadly governmental conflicts compared to the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                 A naive analysis first showed us that the UN was performing as good as other 3rd parties if not worst, but when pushing this observational study further we showed that it is bringing more stability when it is involved in the resolution of a conflict.</p>

                                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                                <p>Our study showed that after matching on the peace agreements and on the conflicts, the UN seems to perform better than other third party actors. Indeed, only 33% of the UN Peace agreements were broken while this number goes up to 42% for other actors. </p>
                            However, it is important to note that performing a Fisher exact test on these proportions outputed a p-value of 0.37 which means that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the UN and other parties are equally likely to have their peace agreement broken. If you are interested in these technical p-values analysis, you can have a look at our notebook. </p>

                        In the domain of conflict resolution, our study showed that the UN have an impact although the relatively high p-value we obtained in the Fisher test cannot prove this impact 'scientifically'. It should be noted that UN biggest challenges does not land in the resolution of existing conflicts but rather in the settlement of communication channels to avoid the creation of tensions between countries. For further research, An analysis of the interactions between state leaders and the tension level between countries could be made.</p>
