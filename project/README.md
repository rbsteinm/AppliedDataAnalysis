# Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society is questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational opinion in the impact of UN peace agreements and the development of wars. First we will make a map display of all violent events through history. We will then connect it to UN peace agreements and compare the growth or decay of violence in the concerned region. Also, we would like to understand the similarities between violent events. We would like to establish a graph where those violent events are nodes and the edges are the similarity between them. They could hold as attributes the actors of the event, the intermediaries, the geological position, the side parties intervening etc...
