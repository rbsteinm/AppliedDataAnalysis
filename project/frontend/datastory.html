                                 <p>The United Nations often gets criticised for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society has often been questioned. The UN exist since 1945, although until today the amount of conflicts around the world has not significantly diminished, does this mean that the UN is inefficient ? The Israelo-Palestinian conflict is allmost as old as the UN and no Peace Agreements could completely stop it as of today, so does the efforts made through the UN organization are worth the results ? Such a question would request more than a statistical study to be answered. Hence, we will focus on studying the impact of the UN in the domain of conflict resolution.
                                 	<br/>
                                 	Our study aims at giving an objective analysis of the impact of UN peace agreements on the evolution of conflicts around the world. We present the results of our analysis as a data story. Information relative to both conflicts and peace treaties are displayed on a world map in order to get an insight on the impact they have on one another.
                                 	<br/>To perform this, we used the UCDP dataset which provides information about the conflicts and peace agreements from 1975 to 2011.</p>

                                <h5>Distribution of the regions according to the Peace agreements</h5>
                                <p>We observe that the regions are not equally distributed, a large proportion of conflicts that take part in Europe or in Africa benefits from a or several peace agreements whereas there is almost no peace agreements in the Middle East or in Asia.
                                <p>The two distributions are indeed very different.</p>

								<p>If we look at the percentage of conflicts that received a PA for each regions, we notice that one third of the conflicts received a peace agreements in Africa, one fourth in Europe, but only 7% in the Middle East.</p>

                                 <p>Here we filter the conflicts in order to only vizualize those who benefited from a peace agreements. We want to study if the distribution for the CID that benefited from a PA where the UN were involved is the same as the distribution for the CID that benefited from a PA where the UN were not involved. Here the distributions are looking alike. The only outliers we would have are for the Middle East and Americas regions. Indeed, in our database the UN never took part in a peace agreement for the Middle East region.</p>

                                 <p>Here we can see a bit of a difference between the distributions. Indeed, when we look at the conflict solved by the UN, Internationalized conflicts represents 20% of it whereas it's less than 10% for the conflicts that received a Peace Agreement but not from the UN.
                                 <p>The UN seem to be more focused on Internationalized conflicts than Interstate conflicts compared to the control distribution.</p>

                                <p>The UN is present in 31% of the agreements and took part to at least one PA for 27 conflicts.</p>
                                In this part, we will explore if the Peace Agreements where the United Nations acted as a third party performed better than the peace agreements where the UN did not act. </p>
                                In order to do so, we will check the proportion of peace agreements that are ended in both cases.</p>

                                 <p>First, let's just compute the proportions straight from our Peace Agreements database. </p>
                                   We observe that 34% of the agreements that included the UN ended, this proportion goes up to 36% for the agreements that did not include the UN. A chi square two-sample proportion test gives us a p-value of 0.82 so we don't reject the null hypothesis that these proportions are equal. This totally naive analysis can't give us a conclusion to our problematic, we can not say anything about the UN performances at this point.</p>

                                <h5>After performing a propensity score matching on the Peace Agreements</h5>
                                <p>Our previous analysis was quite naive as we saw on the earlier part about the PAs that they are not equally dristributed accross the two classes that are UN / not UN.</p>
                                In order to solve this problem, we decided to perform a propensity score matching among the PAs, having the UN involvment as a treatment. To do so, we matched the 68 UN peace agreements using a propensity score mathing algorithm (you can check our notebook for further details).</p>
                                We observe that, after these PAs are matched we have that only 30% of the agreements that did not include the UN ended. With this analysis, ee could think that the UN is performing worst than the other 3rd parties. But it is important to remember that we matched the PAs according to the caracteristics of the peace agreements, not the caracteristics of the conflicts. This means our analysis is still biased as we saw in the first part of this story that the UN solved conflicts that were more deadly and governmental than the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                Let's perform the matching on the conflicts as well to conclude our analysis.</p>

                                <h5>When matching on the conflicts as well</h5>
                                 <p>When matching on the conflicts as well, we observe that 42% of the conflicts solved by another 3rd party than the UN failed. This is way higher than the fail rate of the UN that is of 33%.</p>
                                 When matching on the conflicts, we observe that the UN peace agreements are way more stable than the ones performed by other 3rd parties. Indeed, we observed in the previous parts that the UN was taking care of a larger part of deadly governmental conflicts compared to the other 3rd parties.</p>
                                 A naive analysis first showed us that the UN was performing as good as other 3rd parties if not worst, but when pushing this observational study further we showed that it is bringing more stability when it is involved in the resolution of a conflict.</p>
